Some people can be in a scene like this where there is no accountability and maintain their integrity. I cannot. My sole focus for the rest of my life is on taking care of my family, allowing them safe space to heal and rebuilding their trust. I hope putting this out there will protect my wife from further attacks and finally allow my family some peace.</p><p>On Monday, a publicist for the remaining members of Neurosis released a statement on behalf of the band who expressing their “disgust” over their former bandmates actions and noting that the group parted ways with their co-founder in 2019.</p><p>“Usually, we would view public openness and honesty about mental illness as brave and even productive. We just don’t believe that is the case here,” the statement said. “There is nothing brave about systematically abusing your wife and children. There is nothing brave about confessing wrongdoing when you have not done the work to change your behavior.”</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ39wfJdoaXJnlqS%2FrrHRZqWeraKkwKq%2FjKWcmpxdqLavs8SrZKybn6nBbrfEpaOyZaKawaq%2BxKxkn6qfonquwdKimmaZlqmys3nCqKWfoaKitq%2BzjKuspqeiqHq1tMCtZKGdXZavtr%2FEnWShoaNixKqyxGaYp5xdm66utcuyZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
