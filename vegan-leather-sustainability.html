The adoption of Veganuary in the UK alone is expected to have saved the earth’s atmosphere from the equivalent production of CO2 as 450,000 flights from London to Berlin, as well as 2.5 millions litres of water, according to a study by a professor at the University of Oxford. This is the impact of just 31 days. A more permanent adoption of veganism would, according to another study from the university, be the “single biggest way” to reduce our environmental impact, lowering an individual’s carbon footprint by 73 per cent."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

For us, this is a conscious choice on so many levels.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=56 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Italian artisan tradition of vegetable tanning has been handed down from generation to generation. “It’s beautiful and also supports a more sustainable fashion cycle,” Pizzelli notes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=57 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Not only does vegetable-tanned leather does not contain any toxic substance (such as azo-dyes, nickel, PCP or chrome VI) many tanneries reclaim hides from the food industry to prevent waste, which in turn encourages a recycled closed-loop system.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=58 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With all of this in mind, whilst buying vegan leather means you’re avoiding using animal products, its replacement can sometimes be plastic-based, which is harmful to the environment and takes years to degrade. By opting for real leather, it’s not the actual animal skin that’s bad for the environment as this is a natural product. However, the chemicals used in the tanning process remains harmful and the fact that the leather industry is contributing to deforestation, so it is better to choose leathers that have been vegetable tanned.</p><h2 data-node-id=59 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What if the real leather is a by-product?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=60 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The obvious disadvantage to buying real leather is you’re contributing to animals dying for fashion. Although this can be counteracted by the fact that leather is a by-product of the meat industry, it still remains the same that you’re wearing an animal and some people, depending on their personal ethics, would argue that that sends a message.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=61 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Faux-fur designer Emma Brewin says it’s still unethical to justify using real leather. “I think some people kind of justify buying it because it’s a by-product, but that’s not how I see it at all,” she tells us.</p><img alt="Street Style: September 22 - Milan Fashion Week Spring/Summer 2020" title="Street Style: September 22 - Milan Fashion Week Spring/Summer 2020" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/doina-ciobanu-wears-a-cream-leather-nanushka-button-up-news-photo-1583770742.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Melodie Jeng</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Nanushka is always a hit at Fashion Week street style</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=63 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That being said, with more of us wanting to become more sustainable in fashion and beyond, striving to be zero waste is key. So you could, in theory, argue that using animal skin to make leather goods contributes to no waste. Some other materials like furs can be seen as wasteful, as the whole animal might not be used in some cases. In other words, it’s simply using up resources.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=64 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Some fashion labels adopt this into their designs. Danish brand Saks Potts justifies its use of real leathers in fashion: “Leather is often a by-product from the meat production, which is why many people legalise it more,” Catherine Saks explains. “Danish mink are completely zero waste, the fat is used for fuel on Danish busses, the bones are used as feed to other animals and a large amount are used as fertiliser for organic Danish vegetable production.”<br></p><h2 data-node-id=65 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What leather should I be investing in?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=66 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The answer is not black and white – there are strong arguments on both sides. The best option is to do your research as thoroughly as possible on a case by case basis.</p><img alt="Clothing, Fashion, Khaki, Standing, Shoulder, Fashion design, Outerwear, Coat, Trench coat, Photo shoot, " title="Clothing, Fashion, Khaki, Standing, Shoulder, Fashion design, Outerwear, Coat, Trench coat, Photo shoot, " width=2000 height=2500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/1-1583514250.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Rejina Pyo</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=68 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you are thinking of buying vegan leather, look into what alternatives the brand is using and be aware of the detrimental effects of plastic-based products.
