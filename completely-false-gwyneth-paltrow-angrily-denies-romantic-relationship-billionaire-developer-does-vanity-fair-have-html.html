 Gwyneth Paltrow today denied any 'romantic relationship' with supermodel Elle Macpherson's billionaire husband Jeff Soffer - after it was claimed their friendship may be probed in an explosive new Vanity Fair article.

The magazine was said to be delving into rumours over her friendship with the property developer, according to Page Six, following a 2008 party in Miami during which they were seen looking close."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We reached out to a former personal assistant of Gwyneth’s rumored lover, who was hesitant to provide information.</span></p><p><span>'It appears that the ex-assistant then contacted her former employer, who most likely informed Gwyneth or her representatives immediately, as Star received a threatening letter from the actress’ attorney – which did acknowledge that Gwyneth and the gentleman in question did know each other and had been to dinner together more than once – within hours of speaking with the ex-assistant.</span></p><p><span>'This preemptive strike could be regarded as highly unusual, as Star had not yet undertaken the formality of contacting Gwyneth’s publicist or agent (as we would for any subject of an investigation) to alert them to our upcoming feature and to ask for a comment. We do occasionally receive a legal letter AFTER making this standard “comment call” but to receive such a communication beforehand is almost unheard of.'</span></p><p><span>In the end, Star magazine did not publish the allegation, suggesting it lacked evidence.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/10/18/article-2465993-18D3CD4700000578-438_634x843.jpg height=843 width=634 alt="Hollywood bound: Gwyneth Paltrow and husband Chris Martin recently moved to Los Angeles.
