"If you feel you don’t belong or are not part of something, you don’t produce oxytocin. A walk with friends by the sea will release oxytocin and make everyone feel they belong.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bbc90b9190e2-azores-scenery.jpg><p id=e-1vcUpKBVQ5 data-wc=37>The miles of open sky in the Azores helped, too. "When you look to the sky, it gives a signal to the brain from your eyes to wake up. You will feel instantly energised," Dr. Rachel says.</p><p id=e3WWtaSXB8jH data-wc=31>When we weren't enjoying our outdoor pursuits, our base for our Azorean adventure was the <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Octant Ponta Delgada</a> – and there's no doubt that the luxurious surroundings contributed to our happiness.</p><p id=eUoRHoCew9 data-wc=9><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>How cold-water swimming eased my anxiety and isolation</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eFHKVjrMtev6 data-wc=30>The <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">five-star hotel</a> was the ultimate antithesis to exhausting days, cocooning us in the soothing surroundings, with opulent touches making us feel pampered and relaxed from the moment<strong>&nbsp;</strong>we arrived.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2d05886c1b80-octant-lobby.jpg><p id=eq7b68S-Ab6A data-wc=60>We were greeted with chilled flannels and aromatic water, and the luxury details continued throughout the stay, from hats and bags waiting for us in our room, super soft robes and slippers in abundance, and a valet to park our car when I was feeling particularly frazzled from driving on the other side of the road for the first time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/165a71509d74-octant-bedroom.jpg><p id=ebDaAvm1oYER data-wc=60>After we'd unpacked, we headed upstairs to the rooftop pool and whale-watching bar, soaking in the views of the harbour on one side of the hotel and the botanical gardens on the other side. I defy anyone not to feel relaxed when chilling up there, with the lowkey music tinkling in the background and super comfortable seats to sink into.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f414979def26-octant-rooftop.jpg><p id=eGJwtq2nJT1x data-wc=25>From the very top of the hotel to the very bottom, we check into the hotel's spa after a busy morning of kayaking and paddleboarding.</p><p id=eIWJD55wLukM data-wc=57>The small-but-perfectly-formed spa is designed to feel like home; tranquil and quiet, but not so silent that you feel you can't have a chat with your friends. All three of us booked in for restorative massages to help rejuvenate us after the morning's activities, and while I often leave massages feeling blissed out, this was another level.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e11830062af8-octant-spa.jpg><p id=eqQ_clm8H_X3 data-wc=31>It was as if the massage therapist had ironed out all the knots and tension in my back, with my normally tight shoulders feeling more supple than they have in months.</p><p id=ebMkkhAaRbuB data-wc=25>After our massages, we relaxed in the sauna and steam room, happy in the knowledge that our action-packed break has earned us this pampering time.</p><p id=e6C7MHMg2ZZy data-wc=57>The Octant's restaurant deserves a special mention too; not only does it serve the perfect buffet breakfast with everything you could dream of from fresh fruit and made-to-order eggs, but the dinner menu is exquisite too. We tried barracuda, enjoyed steak and nibbled on cod and every bite was amazing, with fantastic wine options on offer too.</p><p id=e7YrCJBjhfnm data-wc=57>While many people think of the Azores as a purely active break, I think staying somewhere luxurious was the icing on the cake for our happiness-boosting break. There's nothing like a waterfall shower to wash away the mud from hiking, and a seven-choice pillow menu to sink into to make rejuvenate and reset after a jampacked day.</p><p class=MsoNormal id=etx4Ft65tVNc data-wc=7><strong>&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Find out more about Octant Ponta Delgada</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfqb%2BiwsSlZm1xaWeGc3vAs6arnaNiwbOt1Z6jZqqVq7amw4yhmLCZmZ56sLKMnqyrp6CafA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
