During an interview with Hill, Elliott and three other cast members of 1883, Elliott was asked about comments he made during an interview on the podcast, WTF with Marc Maron.
&#34;That movie struck a chord with me and in trying to tell the guy — the WTF guy — about the film I wasn’t very articulate about it,&#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Both appeared at the Deadline Contenders TV event on Sunday (April 10).</p><p>During an interview with Hill, Elliott and three other cast members of&nbsp;1883, Elliott was asked about comments he made during an interview on the podcast,&nbsp;WTF with Marc Maron.</p><p>"That movie struck a chord with me and in trying to tell the guy —&nbsp;the WTF guy — about the film I wasn’t very articulate about it," Elliott says.</p><p class=p1>"And I said some things that hurt people and I feel terrible about that. The gay community has been incredible to me my entire career, and I mean my entire career, before I got started in this town," he continues. "Friends on every level in every job description ...&nbsp;I’m sorry that I hurt any of of those friends and someone that I loved and anyone else by the words that I used."</p><p>At the end of the interview with Maron, Elliott was asked about The Power of the Dog and he called it a "piece of s--t." His remarks about homosexuality were particularly divisive. He compared the cowboys in the movie to&nbsp;Chippendales dancers.</p><p>Director Jane Campion responded to Elliott's comments with a harsh rebuke. "I think it’s really unfortunate and sad for him because he’s really hit the trifecta of misogyny and xenophobia and homophobia," Campion told Deadline last month. “I don’t like that. I think he was being a little bit of a b-i-t-c-h. Plus he’s not a cowboy, he’s an actor."</p><p>At the end of his apology, he specifically apologized to Campion, the cast and Benedict Cumberbatch. "I can only say that I’m sorry. And I am," he said in the slow and measured way he often adopts while making a point in interviews.</p><p>Hill jumped in when&nbsp;Elliott was done to defend his "amazing character." The rest of the panel (Isabel May, LaMonica Garrett and <a href=#>Tim McGraw</a>) nodded in agreement as she said, "Sam, on set, anytime if he’s said something to anyone that may have been taken offensively&nbsp;... he would always — didn’t matter who it was — go over and himself and sit down and apologize."</p><p>Elliott's comments about The Power of the Dog weren't his only controversial remarks —&nbsp;he also blasted 1883 creator Taylor Sheridan's&nbsp;origin story show, Yellowstone.&nbsp;"I’m not a&nbsp;Yellowstone&nbsp;fan. I don’t watch&nbsp;Yellowstone," Elliott says. "I love Costner, there’s a lot of good people on the cast, a few of them I’ve worked with before — nothing against any of them — but it’s just too much like&nbsp;f---ing&nbsp;Dallas&nbsp;or something for me.”</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>PICTURES: See Inside Kevin Costner's Spectacular Colorado Ranch</h2><p>Yellowstone star Kevin Costner lives the ranch life when he's off the set of the hit show, too. The Oscar-winning actor owns a 160-acre ranch in Aspen, Colo., that's a spectacular getaway, complete with a main residence, a lake house and a river house.</p><p>The luxury retreat also features a baseball field, a sledding hill, an ice rink, multiple hot tubs and views of the Continental Divide. The ranch property comfortably sleeps 27 people, and it's currently available to rent for 36,000 a night.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Yellowstone: How Is James Dutton Related to John Dutton?</h2>The relationship between John Dutton on Yellowstone and James Dutton on 1883 was mostly a bar argument until a very pivotal line of dialogue from Ep. 10 of the <a href=#>Tim McGraw</a> show. Suddenly fans wanted to know who the seventh generation Dutton is. We've illustrated the relationships below and found the fact that is tripping people up in the quest to make sense of this family tree.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmn5mZqbVutMilo2arkaJ6prjLoqatrF1mhXl%2FjKmmsJ2iYrynedOhnGacn5x6pLvMppynrKNk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
