At the peak of her </span><i><span>Friends</span></i><span> stardom, the sitcom star earned a cool $1 million per episode. But that’s not all! She is still cashing in on residuals from the show years after its successful decade-long run.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Jennifer-Aniston-Flaunts-Gorgeous-Legs-as-She-Relaxes-in-Short-Bathrobe-at-Home-With-Pup-Chesterfield-Feature.jpg><p><span>The </span><i><span>Just Go With It</span></i><span> star is also making bank on the series </span><i><span>The Morning Show</span></i><span> with </span><a href=#><b>Reese Witherspoon</b></a><span> which premiered in 2019. She owns the production company Echo Films, the studio behind several movies in which she has starred including </span><i><span>Dumplin’ </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>The Switch</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Though she is regarded as one of the most in-demand actresses in Hollywood, her start in the entertainment business came with some hesitation from her family.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Then </span><i><span>Friends</span></i><span> came. If there were any naysayers in my family, ‘This will never … you’ll never make a dime,’” she recalled to </span><a href=#><i><span>People</span></i></a><span> in December 2019 about their initial thoughts. “Just watch me. Don’t threaten me that way. God knows now I’m going to make a couple of dimes.”</span></p><h2><b>Is Jennifer Aniston Married?&nbsp;</b></h2><p><span>The superstar, who frequently vacations in Los Cabos, Mexico, has built quite a massive legacy for herself. Several outlets have estimated that her annual salary is more than $20 million. In 2011, she purchased a <a href=#>$21 million Bel Air mansion</a>. She previously shared the home with her ex-husband </span><a href=#><b>Justin Theroux</b></a><span> whom she split from in 2018.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Jennifer was married once before to </span><a href=#><b>Brad Pitt</b></a><span> from 2000 to 2005. She did not welcome any children during either of <a href=#>her marriages</a>. The California native has been very vocal about her <a href=#>decision to not have children</a>.</span></p><p><span>“We are complete with or without a mate, with or without a child … that decision is ours and ours alone,” she wrote in a piece published by </span><a href=#><i><span>The Huffington Post</span></i></a><span> in 2016. “We don’t need to be married or mothers to be complete. We get to determine our own ‘happily ever after’ for ourselves.”</span></p><p><span>The Emmy winner enjoys her life surrounded by her <a href=#>famous friends</a> like </span><a href=#><b>Courteney Cox</b></a><span> and </span><b>Jason Bateman</b><span> and <a href=#>her adorable pups</a>. When asked if she ever planned on slowing down her career in the future, Jennifer got candid.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I don’t think so. In fact, I’m about to speed up and not be free for two years,” she said during a December 2021 interview with </span><a href=#><i><span>The Hollywood Reporter</span></i></a><span>. “But I’ll schedule it so that I get breaks in between, and not just go back-to-back to back. You need that time to recharge and be with your friends and your family and your dogs.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46jnKemmZuys3nAp6CsrJ%2Bjeq%2Bx02auqKqknXpygpFtaG5n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
