Katya attended and graduated from Desert Mountain High School in Scottsdale, Arizona. During her studies at Desert High, she joined the cheerleading team and distinguished herself as a cheerleader.</p><p>In 2013, the young fitness star wanted to build a muscular and curvy body for herself, but as a cheerleader doing lots of cardiovascular exercises, her dream body seemed far-fetched. She was eating poorly and needed some guidance in building her dream body. Katya was at a loss at this point, but for her mother, who is a personal trainer, she sought her advice on proper nutrition and supplementation; she was also offered a structured training plan. Today she trains four days a week (Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday) and has Tuesday, Friday and Sunday as days off. She often calls herself “the gluteus muscle master” when it comes to her training.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Owen Wilson Bio, Brother, Net Worth, Wife, Kids And Suicide Attempt</a></strong></p><p>Katya began her fitness journey during her senior year in high school in January 2013, and to track her progress on a daily basis, she began posting pictures and videos of herself on Instagram. Even though she had a full-time job as a nanny at the time and could only exercise and post pictures sparingly, she still managed to make it work and find time to do what was necessary.</p><p>She received her first job in January 2013; she had little idea that her continuous posting of short videos and pictures of her curvy, tinted body would become a social media trend overnight. She currently has over 5 million followers on Instagram, several Facebook pages, and more than 84,000 subscribers on YouTube and other social media platforms.</p><p>The Fitness and Instagram model has partnered with fitness and nutritional supplement brand EHPlabs and has starred in Joe Weider’s Olympia Weekend and Body Power Expo. Katya is also a vegetarian and follows a strict and healthy diet. She eats more protein and healthy fats, adding whey protein supplements to support her muscle-building goals. She strongly advises against substituting meals for supplements.</p><p>Going to the gym is difficult for everyone, but Kayta recites her popular mantra to stay focused. “Be motivated. Be active. Be confident. Be yourself”. She believes that her mantra will influence everyone to be better.</p><p>After exceeding her ideal physical goals, Katya was inspired to train friends and family. When she saw how they were making daily progress and realized that their posts were motivating more people to exercise, she decided to choose personal training as a career choice and even started a website called “Workout by Katya”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><figure id=attachment_34516 class="wp-caption aligncenter amp-wp-inline-086b83d24e4412010a175ea3dba11ca3" aria-describedby=caption-attachment-34516></figure><p>This successful entrepreneur was in a charming relationship with the American singer Austin Mahone from December 2015 to February 2017.
