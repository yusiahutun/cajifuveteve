I started off going once a week but I was unable to climb for long because I was so unfit and I found my hands hurt from the roughness of the holds, plus all my muscles ached.</p><p id=ecMoBipznWe data-wc=35>I slowly progressed and now I boulder two or three times a week for hours at a time.

It’s not just a physical workout though, part of the challenge in climbing is working out the solution required to reach the top of the route in front of you. That means climbing offers a unique blend of physical and mental challenge, which encourages mindfulness and has a noticeable positive effect on mental health."</p><h2><strong>A new community</strong></h2><p id=er938zmnpEEh data-wc=24>The staff and other climbers have such a passion for the sport and are keen for everyone to join in and enjoy it too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7b3f3941a747-pxl20231021135304783.jpg><p id=eyM_Uxl_bcoY data-wc=26>I started to get to know the other parents who were there with their children and found a supportive community all keen to see me progress.</p><p id=eDehVwdmqaq4 data-wc=10><strong>&nbsp;READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>What midlife women want you to know about exercise</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eEXzsYEUctVe data-wc=66>I love the community I have found at <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Harrowall</a><strong>, my local spot,&nbsp;</strong>part of<a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">&nbsp;London Climbing Centres</a>. Climbing on my own is not as satisfying and I am less motivated without them. I now have a close-knit group of parents who I climb with each week.
