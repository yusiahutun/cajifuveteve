But nothing compared to what happened during my visit with Lorelai.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/askawitch_question3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/lily-singh-production-company.jpg><p>You may recognize her from Season 19 of <a href=#>The Bachelorette back in 2022</a>. Stathopoulos recalls thinking in 2019 that someday she’d be on The Bachelorette. “I needed to help them. They’re letting these guys walk all over them but they’re goddesses,” she says. Stathopoulos had forgotten about the vision and a few years later, she received the call asking her to do the apple love spell: “I said it’s about time you guys called me.”</p><p>On the episode of <a href=# rel=nofollow>Aven’s hometown date with Rachel</a>, Stathopoulos casts a love spell using an ordinary pantry staple—an apple! It’s one of her oldest and most popular <a href=# id=auto-tag_spells data-tag=spells>spells</a>. She could tell that Aven was scared and she told Rachel not to settle. “Aven ends up getting scared and doesn’t propose, so she dumps him and goes to this other guy that she settled for. Two months later, she catches him cheating and ends up with the original guy we did the apple spell with,” Stathopoulus says.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Stathopoulos comes from a long line of mystical practitioners and she oversees <a href=# rel=nofollow>Crow Haven Corner</a>, the oldest witch shop in Salem, which was also the first witch shop in the U.S. I paid Stathopoulos a visit under the <a href=# id=auto-tag_new-moon data-tag=new-moon>new moon</a> with a dream of pure love in my heart. She sat me down in front of a shiny red apple that had been cleaned and polished. “Put your energy into it from the beginning to the end—from lighting the candle to doing the spell. That’s what makes magic work,” Stathopoulos instructed. “The first thing about love magic is we have to love ourselves. Take a bite of the apple for self-love before you start the love spell.”</p><p>Since I was casting a generic spell without a specific person in mind, we skipped the step of carving the name of the object of my desire into the apple. If you’re casting the spell on a specific person, carve your name into one side of the candle and your potential lover’s name on the other side.</p><p>As per Stathopoulos’ instructions, the love spell should be cast three days before the new moon. “We’re going to call in the New Moon magic and call in the Venus goddess of love, love for yourself, and love to come,” Stathopoulos says.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>She poured honey inside the apple along with rose quartz, coriander seeds, rose petals, and strawberry leaves. According to Stathopoulos, rose quartz is for self-love, rose petals and strawberry leaves are to attract love, and coriander seeds are for wealth. “We all need money. Money is power. We need it to do kind things,” she says.</p><p>To cast the love spell, you’ll need a pink candle (the color associated with true love in <a href=# rel=nofollow>candle magic</a>, while red is for lust). Place the candle in the apple and light it while chanting <a href=# rel=nofollow>Stathopoulos’ love spell</a>. The enchantment calls for a soulmate who will offer protection, provide love, and be full of light. And then she says to “fuggedaboutit,” in true East Coast fashion.</p><p>While you could gather the magical ingredients to conduct Stathopoulos’ love spell, it’s best to <a href=# rel=nofollow>buy the spell kit</a> from Crown Haven Corner that’s been magically charged by the Love Clairvoyant herself. Initially, I felt that casting the spell in person was fruitful for me. A few months later, I had forgotten about casting the spell and started a new relationship. He confessed that everything had been so magical he felt like a love spell had been cast on him. I admitted I had cast a love spell and we both agreed it helped bring us together.</p><p>Stathopoulos gave me a love spell candle to take home and it included instructions to light it with my new love one day. We burned it together and chanted the spell, which was meant to enhance our love. While traveling abroad and spending two months away from the candle, our relationship imploded. Ultimately, he didn’t live up to the enchantments requirement of true love, but I’m still hopeful the goddess Venus will bless me with my soulmate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8uorZ5lo5rFcH2VbnBqaGNkubDCxGauoqyTnXq0rcuepGakn6eyrbHIZqqtmaSdvLG71KWmrGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
