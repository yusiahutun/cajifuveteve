She also has Max & Me and Some Other Woman coming up.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On the television front, Greene, 34, appeared in 17 episodes of DirecTV’s Rogue and YouTube’s Step Up: High Water, which was cancelled and then picked up by Starz. She also appeared in Christmas on My Mind and The Charm Bracelet (originally titled A Little Christmas Charm).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Greene has 1.8 million followers on Instagram and 1.7 million on Twitter.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">9.

She’s appeared in multiple direct-to-video films like Pawn, Empire State, In Your Eyes and About Scout. Reed also appeared in 18 episodes of Sleepy Hollow as Betsy Ross, an episode of Dollface, and five episodes of V-Wars, which starred her husband Ian Somerhalder. Before that, she hadn’t acted since 2016.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Instead, Reed, 33, has been focusing on activism and her sustainable jewellery line, BaYou with Love.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She has currently has 3.6 million Instagram followers and 762,800 Twitter followers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">8.

Once the films ended, Lutz was poised to become one of Hollywood’s next leading men, but due to some questionable career choices, he’s been relegated to TV.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">What was meant to be his big break, 2014’s The Legend of Hercules, ended up being a huge box-office bomb. After that, Lutz had a small role in The Expendables 3 and roles in VOD films like Money and Extraction.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/11/26/c35d8753-8ca4-431c-8cbb-6b4d87d5beb0_0aa50891.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2019, he appeared on two episodes of FBI to set up the new spin-off, FBI: Most Wanted, in which he starred in for the first three seasons. He left the show in September to move back to California with his family.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">5 things to know about Salma Hayek’s daughter, Valentina Paloma Pinault</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He’ll appear in the war film Come Out Fighting with Tyrese Gibson and Dolph Lundgren in 2022, as well as in What Remains with Cress Williams.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lutz has one million followers on Instagram and 877,700 on Twitter.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">7.

Lautner was cast in Twilight as Jacob Black, but he was very close to being re-cast for New Moon and subsequent films due to the physical transformation Jacob went through. Instead, Lautner put on pounds of muscle and remained in the cast.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After Breaking Dawn Part 2, Lautner’s career slowed down. He’s only appeared in four films since the series ended: Grown Ups 2 in an uncredited role, Tracers, The Ridiculous Six and Run the Tide in 2016. But he had a recurring, starring role in BBC One’s Cuckoo from 2014 to 2018, and he appeared in Scream Queens in 2016.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/11/26/aecf4c53-4316-4b5b-803a-9926edd58e4c_4ddecf7b.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, he’ll be returning to the big screen soon, with a role in Home Team, a film based on NFL coach Sean Payton’s time coaching his son’s sixth grade football team.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nostalgia clearly helps Lautner, 29, on social media – he has 7.1 million followers on Instagram.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">6.

She was even nominated for a Young Artist Award.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since then, Foy has appeared in The Conjuring (a mega-hit), Interstellar (mega-hit), and The Little Prince (the most successful French animated film abroad of all time). She got her first chance at a real leading role with The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, which ended up as a box-office bomb, but it had a budget of over US$100 million, which is still a huge opportunity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/11/26/a412ca7e-9c74-49f8-88a9-1e2b7d33af60_944c517d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Foy also starred in Disney+’s Black Beauty in 2020 alongside Kate Winslet, and she has 1.7 million followers on Instagram and 67,900 on Twitter (although she hasn’t tweeted since 2018).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">5.

He joined the X-Men universe in 2014’s X-Men: Days of Future Past as Warpath, starred in all three Descendants films as Jay, the son of Jafar, popped up in Westworld and co-starred in 2020’s Let Him Go with Kevin Costner and Diane Lane.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/11/26/b56814da-6323-4d3c-8e13-8feb9cc93c7a_930f6d83.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Up next is the film Those Who Walk Away with his father, and (potentially) a second season of Julie and the Phantoms on Netflix.

But her big break came in 2020 when she was cast as famed Tejano icon Selena, who was murdered in 1995.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Serratos, 31, played the singer in Netflix’s Selena: The Series, which covers her rise to fame and eventual untimely death.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The first part was released in December 2020, and the second part dropped in May 2021.

In 2020, she starred in the sci-fi horror film Underwater and the first major LGBTQ+ holiday romcom, Happiest Season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/11/26/51fbeb17-ed80-47f7-adc8-e4b346197853_4e18573f.jpg>This year, the 31-year-old took on her most challenging role to date – Princess Diana in the semifictional biopic Spencer – which has earned her rave reviews.

The next year, at the same time as Eclipse, she appeared in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.
