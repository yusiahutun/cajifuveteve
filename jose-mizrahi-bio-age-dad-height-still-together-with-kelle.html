But it’s unclear if they’ve gone their separate ways or continued their relationship outside.</span></p><p><span>Fantasies came true when </span><i><span>M/LF Manor</span></i><span> premiered on January 15, 2023. Older women who also happen to be mothers were dating younger men — almost half their ages! However, the MILFS weren’t simply looking for a good time, but rather a true love who’d be with them when they are even older.</span></p><p><span>Jose was one of the “young men” looking for love on the show. And luckily, he got to choose between three </span><i><span>M/LFs</span></i><span>, either Kelle, SoYoung, or Shannan. And as you may already know he gave his heart to Kelle.</span></p><p><span>Kelle Mortensen is a real estate broker and the owner of </span><i><span>Legacy Broker Inc</span></i><span>. Born and raised in Lansing, Michigan, Kelle started her career working in sales at a very young age. To fulfill her childhood ambitions, she made then the decision in 1997 to emigrate to California with her infant kid. As a single mother trying to make ends meet, this shift became a welcome uphill struggle. With unrelenting determination and desire, she managed to land a job in outside sales and quickly rose to the position of top-earning salesperson, generating over $15 million in annual billing for a business that generated $80 million in revenue in just 4 years.</span></p><p><span>Now, coming back to Jose’s time on </span><i><span>M/LF Manor</span></i><span>, though he went for Kelle, she wasn’t the only one he seemed to have chemistry with. Sparks were flying between Jose and Shannan as well. Moreover, Jose’s mother, Pola Mochon, also gave green light to Shannan.</span></p><h3><b>Jose Mizrahi Age</b></h3><p><span>Jose Mizrahi was 29 years of age when he appeared on </span><i><span>M/LF Manor</span></i><span> in 2023.</span></p><p><span>But he was a year younger when he actually filmed the show.</span></p><h3><span>&nbsp;</span><b>Who Is Jose Mizrahi Dad?</b></h3><p><span>Jose Mizrahi didn’t know his father. His dad passed away when he was barely 3 years old. So practically, he has been the man of his house and the pillar for his mother and sister, all his life.</span></p><p><span>You might have seen his mother, Pola Mochon on </span><i><span>M/LF Manor</span></i><span>. She was also looking for love alongside her son. But unlike her co-stars who were regular in the dating game, she’d been out of it for nine long years.</span></p><p><span>Pola is the CEO and Co-founder of </span><i><span>Powerumba Fitness</span></i><span> located in North Miami, Florida. She founded the company back in October 2012. Today, </span><i><span>Powerumba Fitness</span></i><span> combines rhythms from around the world, the latest workout trends, and the use of technology to create a unique fitness experience. They also provide live classes on IG.</span></p><p><span>Besides his mother, Jose was also close to his sister Emma Mizrahi, an actress, host, and influencer. She’s graced TV shows such as </span><i><span>Enamorándonos, La Mujer De Mi Vida</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>La Apuesta Creando Una Estrella</span></i><span>, and commercials for Goya Food, Walt Disney World, and Spectrum Mobile. Also, Emma is a Broadcasting Media student from </span><i><span>Florida International University</span></i><span>. Right after college, she joined </span><i><span>SOCLUB</span></i><span> as its host and has been working there ever since.</span></p><p><span>In Jan 2023, she flaunted 114K followers on IG @</span><a href=#><span>emmamizrahi</span></a><span> and 529K followers on TikTok @</span><a href=#><span>emosa</span></a><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Jose Mizrahi Job</b></h3><p><span>Jose Mizrahi is a Talk show host, actor, reality TV figure, model, and influencer.
