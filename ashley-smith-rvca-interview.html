With her prominent gap-tooth smile, Ashley Smith burst onto the modeling scene a few years ago as, &#34;the next Lara Stone.&#34; But she's quickly proven that she's unlike anyone else—with her carefree attitude and bi-polar style that she describes as either femme fatale or school girl. It's no wonder that the cool West Coast skate and surf brand RVCA asked her to collaborate, following a successful collaboration with supermodel Erin Wasson."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It's no wonder that the cool West Coast skate and surf brand <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rvca.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=RVCA data-vars-ga-product-id=654dd78b-6ccc-410e-afd5-1a82473fad19 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.rvca.com/ data-product-url=https://www.rvca.com/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rvca.com%2F" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=31da39f1-181e-4874-aac8-6da6d6f5fd70 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">RVCA</a> asked her to collaborate, following a successful collaboration with supermodel Erin Wasson. The clothes turned out much like Smith herself, girly and a little naughty. We chatted with the Texas native about having multiple modeling agencies fighting over her and landing her own clothing line by proving she can hang with the boys.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How did you get discovered?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I'm from Texas first off, so my senior year of high school I was at the Southwest music festival and a scout from my mother agency, Foreman management, walked up to me and asked if I wanted to model—and that they could get me started in New York. I just thought, anything was better than working in a grocery store. I was about to graduate high school and I didn't really feel like going to college just yet. So I took some pictures with them, and they were a little unsure because I was shorter than most runway models. I was a risk, and they didn't know if they wanted to take me on. So, they bought me a ticket to go to New York City. I had a bunch of meetings with different agencies—and by the end of it, I had three agencies fighting over me.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What's your favorite thing about modeling?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I'd have to say the collaboration. What inspired me most and got me excited about this job was that I got to create something in an essence—I got to create a mood or a feeling. I love being in front of the camera first off, it's just fun I like to just mess around and dance. I'm really not a poser, I guess is what you can say— when I go to castings and they're like, "show me your three favorite poses," I'm like, "can I just dance for a second?" I think that's one thing photographers really like about me.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What advice would you give to someone who wants to be a model?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This may sound really cheesy but what helped me when I first started in this industry, was to follow my gut. A lot of people will tell you a lot of stuff to get you to go to an agency or to get you to do whatever and I think if you feel that something's uncomfortable or if you feel that something is wrong, listen to yourself. I had so many people in my ear, when I first started, who told me "this is wrong", "this is right". At the end of the day I had my own feelings about what was wrong and what was right, no matter how many people told me something was the opposite. I still was like, "I don't feel like this agency is working for me in the right way that I want it to."</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How would you describe your personal style?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I've been kind of developing my personal style over the last couple of years. I like to experiment with two extremes. One is very girly, very '50's, like high-waisted skirts and cropped sweaters in pastel colors. I can get really girly, but I like to have a sexy edge—you know very short skirts, thigh-high stockings—a bit of a schoolgirl look. Then on the other side if I'm wearing pants I go for the femme fatale look where it's very sharp—leather jacket, leather boots. I'm wearing a beret on the side, I've got like a cigarette holder it's very like I'm about to crack open a safe and steal some money. But it all depends on how I feel when I wake up.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What are some of your favorite brands to wear?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I really love Balenciaga, I like Chanel bags of course, I mean that's an obvious. I wear Reformation a lot—I really love what Yaya [Aflalo] is doing—she just gets what girls want today. I really love Acne as well, and Opening Ceremony.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What's your most prized possession in your closet?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Man, that's hard. It'd probably have to be my Balenciaga jacket. I love it so much and I wear it all the time, unfortunately it's too cold right now. Or these Acne high-waisted jeans I have on right now, I wear them all the time. They just fit really nice, I think everyone has them. Those are two things I can't live without, I'm in them all the time.</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What's on your shopping list for spring?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A pair of Miu Miu platform shoes, I buy a pair every season.</p><h2 data-node-id=32 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How did your collaboration with RVCA come about?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Actually, it's kind of funny; when I first started modeling I did a little shoot with this photographer Mike Piscitelli. It wasn't for an editorial or anything; he just wanted to take some photos of me. I didn't hear from him for like three or four years, and all of the sudden he comes up out of the blue and he was like "Oh hey, I really liked the pictures we took together. My friend Pat is looking for this girl to kind of do a collaboration with a capsule collection with, you know Erin Wasson just did it. Anyway, he's in town and he's looking for girls to collaborate with and would like to meet with you." So, I was said sure, let's meet him. I was thinking it was just going to be me, Mike and his friend—but I walked in to a room at the Mercer Hotel with about 8 skater dudes, and I was wearing my usual little short skirt and crop top.</p><h2 data-node-id=36 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How did you know they were the right ones to collaborate with?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It was interesting to walk into that and see all these manly men, like dudes who were really cool and easy to talk to. When I left the meeting I felt confident like, "yeah that's in the bag." Not being cocky, it was just so organic and it felt like if I'm what they're looking for then this is going to happen because we got along well, we were making jokes, you know. It just seemed right.</p><h2 data-node-id=40 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What kind of girl do you envision wearing these clothes?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I think that, I've made the collection for a wide spectrum of girls. For this first collection, because I do love cropped and lace things, I did incorporate those details into the collection. I feel like the type of girl who would want to wear it would be someone who wants to show off a little or who's not afraid to be a little sexy. It's definitely more sexy than RVCA is used to.</p><h2 data-node-id=44 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What do you like to do when you're not working?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I really watch a lot of movies. I like action; I like comedy, movies with a femme fatale character like Kill Bill. Mostly comedy and action are my favorites. I love to dance, I ride my bike, exercise, and just hang out with friends.</p><h2 data-node-id=48 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What's your workout routine like?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I've got a trainer. I do a lot of cardio and lifting weights. I'm trying to get into yoga because it keeps you lean.</p><h2 data-node-id=52 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Do you have any beauty secrets?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=54 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Being a girl who dyes her hair a lot, it's all about restorative care. Healthy masks and that restore your hair because I'm dying it all the time and with the hair dryers and curlers on set—it's so bad for your hair. I like to put Moroccan oil before shoots because it helps protect the hair or using leave in conditioners that help to protect it from heat. For my skin, I'm all about moisturizing all the time—I have dry skin and I love to use Queen Helene mint julep mask, it's the best and it's like $3.</p><h2 data-node-id=56 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Where would you like to travel in 2014, that you haven't been yet?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=58 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I really want to go to Ireland, does that sound boring? Because that's been my dream since I was a little girl, I want to have a wedding like out in the middle of the green countryside. I want to go to Costa Rica really bad as well. I want to go live in a tree house for a few months in Costa Rica, be a little jungle lady for a bit. Jungle Ashley, yeah.</p><img alt="this image is not available" title="this image is not available" width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1643411268.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Media Platforms Design Team</span></p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/6596416d-7fe0-4447-a1bb-29857d998209_1532371556.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chrissy Rutherford" title="Headshot of Chrissy Rutherford" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Chrissy Rutherford is a contributing editor at HarpersBazaar.com</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfm660tMiopWiln5myrb%2BOmmhtbmZkrrS0y56wZqudnsGpedGvmpplmaPBpr7VopywZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
