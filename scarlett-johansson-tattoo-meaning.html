She's got nine altogether, ranging from barely-there micro ink to a huge piece on her back that made headlines when she showed it off for the very first time. Here's a comprehensive list of Johansson's collection, from a tiny A to the tattoo that connects (almost) all of the Avengers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Unfortunately for anyone looking for deep insight into each of her tattoos, Johansson's kept quiet behind the meaning of most of them. A few are easy to interpret, however — especially if her Avengers co-stars blab.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Interlocked Circles With the Letter A</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Timothy Hiatt / Contributor</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of Johansson's more subtle tattoos, this one's on the inside of her right ankle and doesn't get the attention that many of her other ones does. Johansson hasn't revealed what the A could refer to, however.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Lamb with Floral Design</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>VALERIE MACON / Contributor</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Back in 2018, Johansson's back piece made its debut at the Met Gala — but it wasn't until a year later that fans got a better look at it. It was framed just about perfectly when she wore a cut-out crystal dress at the premiere of Avengers: Endgame in April 2019. She hasn't shared the meaning behind this one, either, but her daughter is named Rose Dorothy Dauriac.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Artist Josh Lord gave a peek into the process with this post on Instagram.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Rose</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dan MacMedan / Contributor</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A smaller floral design is on Johansson's ribcage. Thanks to her go-to red carpet cutouts, fans have gotten a close look at this one.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Flying Owl</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Karwai Tang / Contributor</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On the other side of her ribcage, Johansson has a flying owl inked on her skin.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>"Lucky You" and a Horseshoe</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another piece on her ribcage, Johansson enlisted French tattooist and graffiti artist, Fuzi Uvtpk for an upside-down horseshoe and the words "Lucky You." This one is high up on her ribs, so it doesn't get as much attention as a few of her other more prominent tattoos. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a> reports that she got the piece in Paris back in 2012.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Avengers Logo</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>CHRIS DELMAS / Contributor</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lord is also behind the one tattoo that almost all the Avengers share. He told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener noreferrer">Revolver Magazine</a> that he personalized each actor's piece. "There's a symbol for everybody in the movie hidden in there," he said. "Their initials are also all hidden in there."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Johansson has hers on the inside of her right arm. Her co-star offered a little more insight into the big-time bonding moment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Five of the original six Avengers got a tattoo. And the sixth was the tattoo artist, who gave it to five of us, the one who opted out being Mark Ruffalo," Robert Downey Jr. told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Entertainment Weekly</a>. "It was Johansson's idea, and she and Evans did it in New York. Then, their New York guy, Josh Lord, who is amazing, flew out to Los Angeles, he did me, did Renner, and then we just bullied Hemsworth into doing it, and he got it."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Sunrise</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Mike Marsland / Contributor</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike her other tattoos, the sunrise on Johansson's left forearm is a colorful, bright piece — and she's talked about it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I've had the tattoo of a sunrise on my arm for a while," she said, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Zimbio</a>. "It makes me happy when I look at it, but the reason I had it done is very personal. Some things have to remain private."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Bracelet</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Taylor Hill / Contributor</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The delicate bracelet tattoo on Johansson's right wrist might look simple, but it's more than just a dainty chain. The charm is actually a Thor's Hammer (not Black Widow's ... zap sticks?) and the tattoo says "I [heart] NY." Johansson was born in New York City, so it's only natural that she has a sweet homage to the city.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e9KcmKuklanBbrbOoZinq6Oku3C%2FwpqppZ2kqXqru8eapayrn6N6ta3TraaoZZ2arq%2B1zaA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
