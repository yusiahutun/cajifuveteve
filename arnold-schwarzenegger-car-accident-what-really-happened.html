As he neared the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Allenford Avenue, he collided with a red Prius, making a U-turn.</p><p><a href=#>Reports</a> showed the SUV was on Sunset Blvd, attempting to turn left in the opposite direction when the collision happened. The impact of the crash caused his vehicle to roll over and land atop the Prius.</p><p>It continued rolling left into a Porsche Taycan, deploying the airbags in the process. The driver of the Prius ended up injured, bleeding heavily from her head, while Arnold and the others involved went unscathed.</p><p>The 75-year-old stayed at the scene of the accident until law enforcement arrived.

One eyewitness likened the accident scene to a movie stunt.</p><p>“Body By Jake” star Jake Steinfeld, who was Chairman Schwarzenegger’s Council on Physical Fitness during his time as Governor of California, was also present at the scene and stood by to support his pal.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=An_Accident_Victims_Account_of_The_Arnold_Schwarzenegger_Car_Accident></span><strong>An Accident Victim’s Account of The Arnold Schwarzenegger Car Accident</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Following the accident, one of the drivers affected shared her side of the story while speaking with the press. The driver, identified as Habiba Muminova, recalled driving her car on the lane next to Arnold Schwarzenegger when the accident happened.</p><p><a href=#>According to</a> the driver, she was waiting at a red light to turn on Sunset Boulevard when the SUV collided with a red Prius. The impact of the collision caused the actor’s rear tire to be discharged.</p><p>Due to the proximity of her car to the vehicles involved, one of the rear tires came straight for her vehicle, landing on the driver’s side window. His SUV ended up blocking her driver-side door, forcing Muminova to extricate herself from the car through the passenger side.</p><p>The jolt was so strong that she felt she had broken her spine. Additionally, her vehicle suffered severe damages, making it impossible for her to continue her job of conveying people to the hospital.</p><p>First responders advised the woman to visit a hospital. However, she declined, opting to remain at the scene with the patient she was transporting.</p><p>After the accident, the actor alighted from his SUV, to her surprise.&nbsp; Despite being a huge fan of Arnold’s, Muminova admitted she wished their meeting had happened under different circumstances.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/20221130_173914.jpg><p>While it is unclear if there was any legal implication on Schwarzenegger resulting from the driver’s complaint, Muminova confirmed that she reached out to her legal attorney for advice.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Was_At_Fault_In_The_Arnold_Schwarzenegger_Accident></span><strong>Who Was At Fault In The Arnold Schwarzenegger Accident?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Although the complete details about the incident and investigative findings were not immediately made public, several sources confirmed Arnold Schwarzenegger was <a href=#>at fault</a> in the car accident.</p><p>Per the unofficial determination, the actor made a left turn against a red light, causing him to collide with the Prius, which had the right of way. Notably, the accident came in the wake of the star’s finalization of his divorce from his former wife, Maria Shriver.</p><p>Notwithstanding, reports showed Schwarzenneger was not ticketed after the crash.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Schwarzenegger_Embroiled_In_Another_Accident_Case></span><strong>Schwarzenegger Embroiled In Another Accident Case</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Months after his infamous car accident, Arnold Schwarzenneger found himself involved in another car accident drama. This time, it involved his son Joseph Baena.</p><p>The man, who is the lovechild from the “Terminator” star’s affair with his housekeeper, Mildred Baena, allegedly <a href=#>crashed</a> into another driver on the 405 Freeway in Los Angeles county.</p><p>The accident victim reportedly filed a lawsuit against Shwarzenneger’s company Oak Productions. Per the lawsuit, the car accident occurred on April 5, 2021, in Culver City, California.</p><p>The court documents stated that Joseph, the love child of Arnold Schwarzenegger, was following closely behind the plaintiff at an unsafe speed. His negligence and carelessness led to the accident, which left the victim with injuries causing severe mental, nervous and physical suffering and pain.</p><p>While it is unclear what part Scwarzenneger’s company played in the accident, the victim demanded 1.5 million dollars in damages.</p><p>Much like his <a href=#>iconic 80’s movie</a> character, the terminator, Arnold Schwarzenegger, has seen his fair share of mechanical, action-packed traffic encounters in recent times.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51krrO6zqWbZquTncSivtmepZ6fl5q%2Fbq%2FAq2Sam5Oesaa602auoZmkYr%2BmrculsGagkaW9prrEnWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
