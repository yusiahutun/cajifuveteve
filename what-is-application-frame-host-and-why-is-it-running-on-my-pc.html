These are generally acquired from the Windows Store, although most of Windows 10's included apps like Mail, Calculator, OneNote, Movies & TV, Photos, and Groove Music are also UWP apps.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Specifically, this process is responsible for displaying these applications in frames (windows) on your desktop, whether you're using Windows 10 in desktop mode or <a href=#>tablet mode</a>. If you forcibly end this process, all your open UWP apps will close.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why (Most) Desktop Apps Aren't Available in the Windows Store</a></span></p><p>These apps are <a href=#>more sandboxed than traditional Windows apps</a>. Unlike traditional Windows desktop apps, often referred to as Win32 apps, UWP apps are limited in what they can do. For example, they can't snoop on data contained in other apps. That's likely why they require an additional process to display their content on the Windows desktop. However, Microsoft doesn't provide any official documentation that explains exactly what&nbsp;this process is responsible for.</p><h2 id=why-is-it-using-cpu-and-memory>Why Is It Using CPU and Memory?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/img_59b1c47c3f090.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In normal PC use, the Application Frame Host process should sit in the background and use only a small amount of CPU and memory. When we launched eight UWP apps on our system, we saw its memory usage rise to only 20.6 MB. The process used less than 1% of CPU for a few moments when we launched a UWP app, and otherwise used 0% CPU.</p><p>We've seen some reports that this process can use a large amount of CPU resources in some situations. It's unclear what can cause this, and it sounds like a bug somewhere in Windows 10. If you find this process is using too much CPU, we encourage you to simply sign out&nbsp;of Windows and sign back in (or end the process in the Task Manager, which will also close your open UWP apps). This will cause Windows to restart&nbsp;the&nbsp;process and the problem will hopefully be fixed.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Repair Corrupted Windows System Files with the SFC and DISM Commands</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If the problem continues, we recommend normal troubleshooting steps. First, try running Windows Update to install the latest updates, which may fix the problem. <a href=#>Run the SFC and DISM commands</a> to attempt to repair corrupted system files. If nothing fixes the problem, you may even want to try&nbsp;<a href=#>resetting Windows to a fresh state</a>.</p><h2 id=can-i-disable-it>Can I Disable It?</h2><p>You can't actually disable this process. If you right-click it in the Task Manager and select "End Task", the process will be closed. All your open UWP or Store apps---the new type of app included with Windows 10---will also be closed. The next time you open a UWP app, though, Windows will automatically launch the Application Frame Host process once again. It's started as needed by Windows 10 in the background, and you can't stop it.</p><h2 id=is-it-a-virus>Is It a Virus?</h2><p>To check that the Application Frame Host process running on your system is the real thing, right-click it in the Task Manager and select "Open file location".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/img_59b1c4a5b1cf5.png><p>You should see a File Explorer window showing the ApplicationFrameHost.exe file in C:\Windows\System32.
