Live streaming services like Amazon Prime Video make it easier to watch a game from almost any city. However, you will need to pony up some cash for an add-on.</p><h2 id=you-can-watch-mlb-games-with-mlb-tv>You can watch MLB games with MLB.TV</h2><p>If you want to watch MLB games on Amazon Prime Video, you will need to add the MLB.TV channel to your membership. At $24.99 per month, the add-on is definitely pricier than most other Prime Video channels, but it's still cheaper than other all-access sports extras like <a href=#>NFL Sunday Ticket on YouTube TV</a>.</p><p>MLB.TV subscribers can watch out-of-market MLB games that don't have any regional or national restrictions. You will need a Prime Video membership to access the MLB.TV channel on Prime, but once you have that, getting to MLB games is easy.</p><p>Purchase of MLB.TV is only available while the season is happening. The steps below will not work during the offseason.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To add the MLB.TV channel to Amazon Prime, log into the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Amazon website</a> on a computer or mobile device.

In-market games are those that show your local team. For example, if you live in Michigan, the Detroit Tigers are in-market games, while the Colorado Rockies would be out-of-market.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For most customers, MLB.TV is designed to watch out-of-market games. However, if an out-of-market game is airing on a national network in your area, it won't be available for live streaming on MLB.TV. MLB on FOX national games, for example.</p><p>A select number of subscribers can also watch in-market games on the app. Local fans of the San Diego Padres and Arizona Diamondbacks can watch live in-market games on MLB.TV as long as there are no national restrictions.</p><h2 id=compatible-devices-for-mlb-games>Compatible devices for MLB games</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Person-holding-a-blue-Amazon-Fire-7-2022-tablet.jpg><p>You can watch MLB.TV on Prime using any device that is compatible with Prime Video.
