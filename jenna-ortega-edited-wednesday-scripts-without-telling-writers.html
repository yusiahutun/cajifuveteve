"When I first signed onto the show, I didn't have all the scripts. I thought it was going to be a lot darker. It wasn't… I didn't know what the tone was, or what the score would sound like."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:aeadbafc-36e9-4dfb-99a0-37fb7f8e865b data-container-ref=toofab:article:876532cf-9b26-410b-a4ea-98cb598869fd data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/36/5by4/2022/11/27/369a3c26986f41c484c31cfeb3d3fc46_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Why Jenna Ortega Didn't Ask Her Wednesday Co-Star Christina Ricci for Any Advice</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The "Scream VI" star called her behavior "almost unprofessional" as she would change lines without consulting the writers responsible for the script. Ortega claimed Wednesday's original dialogue was far from the original "Addams Family" character's trademark morbid and deadpan personality traits.</p><p>"I don't think I’ve ever had to put my foot down more on a set in a way that I had to on 'Wednesday,'" she continued. "Everything that Wednesday does, everything I had to play, did not make sense for her character at all."</p><p>Ortega gave examples of plot points and lines she didn’t feel worked for the titular character.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:26ae7ef2-ef53-4426-9d87-a207fea15eee data-container-ref=toofab:article:876532cf-9b26-410b-a4ea-98cb598869fd data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d1/5by4/2022/12/06/d1ea81788a59452a8bb4c86dfd214809_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Netflix</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Netflix's 'Wednesday' Slammed After Jenna Ortega Reveals She Shot Dance Scene While Sick with COVID</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Her being in a love triangle? It made no sense," she explained. "There was a line about a dress she has to wear for a school dance and she says, 'Oh my god I love it. Ugh, I can't believe I said that. I literally hate myself.' I had to go, 'No.' There were times on that set where I even became almost unprofessional in a sense where I just started changing lines."</p><p>According to the "Scream VI" actress, there were times the script supervisor believed she was working with her given script until she sat down with writers and they questioned her edits.</p><p>"They'd be like, 'Wait, what happened to the scene?' And I'd have to go and explain why I couldn’t go do certain things," Ortega continued.</p><p>"I grew very, very protective of her," she said, explaining she wanted to play a more three dimensional Wednesday. "You can't lead a story and have no emotional arc because then it's boring and nobody likes you. When you are little and say very morbid, offensive stuff, it's funny and endearing. But then you become a teenager and it’s nasty and you know it. There’s less of an excuse."</p><a id=gallery-link-234a1a2d-0bd7-4331-b249-cbea7dec8775 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:234a1a2d-0bd7-4331-b249-cbea7dec8775 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:876532cf-9b26-410b-a4ea-98cb598869fd data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/33/4by3/2023/03/09/330519d0845c4499ab8b752e214a8a12_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2xmaXBfn7KvusBmpquslZyubrHDoquenF2ssqW6xKybmrFdqLCztc%2Btqmavmam1sMHTZquepJyeu6h51qugrZ2iqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
