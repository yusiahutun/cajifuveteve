Not only were we shocked by how tall and handsome Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt’s son Maddox was at Wednesday’s Maleficent premiere, but we were also surprised to learn the 12-year-old has a girlfriend!
And his proud mom couldn’t help but gush about the lucky lady! “He’s dating, he’s got a girlfriend,” Angelina revealed. “She’s great.” Though the 38-year-old vowed, “I won’t embarrass him,” she did let slip where the young girl is from."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It’s really, really sweet,” Angelina tells Entertainment Tonight of her oldest’s first relationship. “She’s a great lady, so I’m lucky. So far, we’re doing good.”</p><p>Despite the interest in his love life, Maddox didn’t manage to steal the show from his stylish mom, who wowed in a black leather strapless Atelier Versace gown. And although Maleficent served as youngest daughter <strong>Vivienne’s</strong> acting debut, the adorable 5-year-old was no where to be seen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-kids-maleficent-3.jpg> Angelina with Vivienne in “Maleficent”<p>“We think it’s fun for our kids to have cameos and join us on set, but not to be actors,” Angelina previously told EW of working with her child. “That’s not our goal, for Brad and I, at all. But the other three and four-year-old [performers] wouldn’t come near me.”</p><p>She added, “It had to be a child that liked me and wasn’t afraid of my horns and my eyes and my claws. So it had to be Viv.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46apaCdnJ67onnJqKOinV2ovaq4y6xkraCVYq%2Bmrc2sZKimXai8r3nMmpudp6hiwG6zyKujn6qZmruleZJxb2ttXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
