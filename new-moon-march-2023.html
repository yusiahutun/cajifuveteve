Not only does this mean flowers are blooming and the days are lengthening, but it also means we’re all turning the page and embracing a new astrological calendar. That’s right—the real “New Year” doesn’t take place until March 20, because <a href=# id=auto-tag_astrology data-tag=astrology>astrology</a> follows the lunar calendar, not the 365-day Gregorian calendar that we’ve all come to know and follow.</p><p>That makes this particular new moon incredibly special. Not only are there <a href=#>several numerological coincidences</a> surrounding this new moon and adding to its fatefulness, but this also represents a galvanizing and rejuvenating shift in our social and spiritual energy. If you’ve been feeling extra sleepy as the sun wraps up its tour through dreamy and divine Pisces, now’s the time to wake up and smell the coffee. The <a href=#>new moon in Aries has arrived</a> and it’s rebooting your system and kickstarting a new chapter in your life. Here’s what you need to know:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/marsretrogradezodiacsigns.png><h2>The New Moon in Aries of March 2023, Explained</h2><p>This new moon takes place in courageous, competitive and compassionate Aries, landing at exactly 0 degrees and emphasizing just now much of a new beginning this really is. Forget what happened yesterday, because <a href=#>the future is yours to create</a>! In astrology, degree 0 indicates the most pure and distilled expression of the zodiac sign in question. And because this new moon rises in Aries—the first sign in the zodiac—you can expect this new moon to reveal clues as to what the future might hold. After all, whatever you start now will manifest over the course of the next six months, reaching a conclusion by the <a href=# id=auto-tag_full-moon data-tag=full-moon>full moon</a> in Aries, which takes place on September 29. This new moon also rises at 1:23, which is <a href=#>a very good sign in numerology</a> and indicates that we are embracing an upward climb.</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1><p>The new moon in Aries takes place on March 21 at 1:23 p.m. ET.</p></figure><p>Because this new moon takes place in Aries, the planet ruling over this new moon is <a href=#>Mars in Gemini</a>. In astrology, Mars is the planet of power, motivation, ambition sexuality, passion, aggression and of course, conflict. Because this new moon is also squaring off with Mars, this lunation is jam-packed with potent energy that’s ready to burst. Sometimes, things begin soft and subtle, gradually introducing you to this new era. Sometimes, things begin with a bang, shocking you out of your stupor and forcing you to get with the program immediately. And although things will start to move *very* fast, this new moon will remind you that you are more than capable of not just keeping up with the pace, but facilitating it.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SC-newsletter-banner-.jpeg alt="newsletter banner" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme9mom6KZk2R%2BdIKRbmlpZ56axG65zqilZqWRp7CpeZFpaWxn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
