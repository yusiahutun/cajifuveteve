Since being born to King Charles and <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>, he has been photographed and interviewed endless times. The <a href=#>royal</a> has grown up in the eyes of the world, much like his brother William and his parents before him. Similar to William and his dad, <a href=#>Prince Harry</a>‘s hair has seemingly begun to thin out over recent years, which is no uncommon sight. But one hair expert has claimed the stress of dealing with the tension with his family in The Firm may be playing a role.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-s-hair-through-the-years>Prince Harry’s hair through the years</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-52119610-1024x653.jpg><p>The royal’s bright locks shined through since he was a teen. Photos of his uncle Charles Spencer in his younger years show a similar shade. It’s likely where the genes came from on his mother’s side.</p><p>When he was a wee nipper, he had thick strawberry blonde locks and sported similar hairstyles to his older brother.</p><p>In adorable photos with <a href=#>Diana without her tiara</a> as the three enjoyed days out, his playful side was a joy for all fans to see.</p><p>However, in recent years it appears his hair has begun to thin on top. And it’s following the footsteps of his brother William and dad <a href=#>King Charles.</a> Now, one hair expert has weighed in.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-stress-over-recent-years-will-have-definitely-impacted-prince-harry-s-hair>‘Stress over recent years will have definitely impacted’ Prince Harry’s hair</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-1258529908-1024x683.jpg><p>Spencer Stevenson, from Spex Hair, told The Daily Star he thinks genes and stress have plagued the royal’s luscious locks.</p><p>He <a href=# rel=nofollow>said</a>: “Harry’s hair loss is categorically male pattern baldness, so already thinning out due to his genes.</p><p>“However, due to the high amount of stress he must’ve been through in recent years dealing with all the exposure surrounding him and his life, it will have definitely negatively impacted his hair.”</p><p>Stevenson added the “relationship with his estranged family” wasn’t helping the situation.</p><p>He also believes Prince Harry may be trying to use celebrity products to help combat the thinning of his hair. Claiming “Nanogen fibers” are a “go-to weapon” in disguising hair loss.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-photo-that-had-fans-talking>The photo that had fans talking</h2><p>The BetterUp <a href=# rel=nofollow>website</a> uploaded a photo of the Duke, who is their Chief Impact Officer. However, fans noticed that the locks on top of his head appeared fuller than recent sightings of him in Singapore the same week.</p><p>Fans on <a href=#>Twitter</a> and other social media platforms were sharing the images side by side as a comparison. Others were wondering why the two seemed so vastly different.</p><p>But, hair isn’t exactly off the table of conversation for Prince Harry.</p><p>In his memoir, Spare, he even made a swipe at brother <a href=#>Prince William</a>‘s baldness, earlier this year.</p><p>In the book, which was released in January, he was talking about seeing members of his family at Prince Philip’s funeral in 2021.</p><p>“I looked at Willy, really looked at him, perhaps for the first time since we were little,” Harry penned. He then described Wills’ thinning hair as “alarming”, before adding it was “more advanced than mine”. Even though the brothers are only two years apart in age.</p><p>Harry has been in the BetterUp role since 2021. It was announced weeks after he and <a href=#>Meghan sat down for the bombshell interview with Oprah</a>. At the time, Alexi Robichaux, the company’s CEO, said Harry was taking on a “meaningful” role.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-solo-trip-to-back-to-britain>Solo trip to back to Britain</h2><p>The Duke is preparing for the Invictus Games in Dusseldorf, Germany. It comes as his <a href=#>Netflix</a> docuseries, Heart of Invictus, was recently released on the streaming platform.</p><p>In the series, he bravely opens up over his mental <a href=#>health</a> and the struggles he faced while growing up. The 38-year-old also appears to make a royal dig at dad Charles. It’s over the trauma he faced following the death of his mother, Diana, in 1997. The show follows a number of athletes across the world as they prepare for the 2022 Games. Injured war veteran athletes compete in a series of grueling and exciting sporting events.</p><p>Harry is currently set to attend the WellChild award show ceremony on the eve of the death of <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a>. Last year, <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> and Harry were set to attend, but it sadly took place as the monarch fell ill. Instead, the dad-of-two rushed to be at her bedside at Balmoral.</p><p>As he’ll be in the UK for a short space of time ahead of the games, sources claimed <a href=#>Harry and Charles were considering ‘peace talks’</a> to bridge the gap over recent tensions.</p><p>But Meghan Markle will be absent, much like other trips Harry went solo. Instead, the Duchess will be joining him after the sporting event begins.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlxX2V%2FcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2GajqKuZo7RutMisZKGZmad6pLvUpZtmmpVis7O7zGarnqajnryvedaiq6Flp565rbXApmSappRisKmt0aWcrGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
