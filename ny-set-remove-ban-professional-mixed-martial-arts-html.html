The more famous MMA promotion Ultimate Fighting Championship lobbied hard for years to convince state politicians to legalize it, bringing marquee fighters like Jon Jones and Ronda Rousey to Albany's Capitol.

Several of his guys had 15 or 20 amateur fights, while in other states most have only four or five before turning professional.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>For the New Yorkers, travel would have cost anything they made. The ability to sell hometown tickets could change that math, though the high insurance requirements may keep smaller promoters out of the market, he said.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>However, Holmes has at least two fighters, featherweight Eric Mendiola and lightweight Pete San Antonio, who've each fought professionally twice for smaller promotions following long amateur careers. 'They're at the level that's going to be noted,' he said.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>There are a dozen or more amateur promotions in New York, including some that sell tickets to mismatches with barely trained fighters, Holmes said.
