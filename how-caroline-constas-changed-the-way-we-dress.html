If you have Instagram, then you'll be aware of Caroline Constas. Her off-the-shoulder silhouettes are to influencer holidays what bubble is to squeak – you can't have one without the other.
Her inherently wearable, floaty dresses, tops and skirts have developed a cult-like following, but it all started with a love of shirts – which remains a mainstay of the brand. The New York-based Canadian designer saw a gap in the market in shirting that felt modern, stylish and office-appropriate, so she decided to make her own."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Her off-the-shoulder silhouettes are to influencer holidays what bubble is to squeak – you can't have one without the other.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her inherently wearable, floaty dresses, tops and skirts have developed a cult-like following, but it all started with a love of shirts – which remains a mainstay of the brand. The New York-based Canadian designer saw a gap in the market in shirting that felt modern, stylish and office-appropriate, so she decided to make her own.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"For years, purely as a consumer, I found myself searching for beautiful wearable shirting with an elevated twist," Constas told us. "I wasn't able to find them anywhere at a contemporary price point so I decided to start sourcing fabric.I did several months' worth of research and found some of the top shirting mills in Italy. I knew then that I had stumbled upon something that would be really exciting to the market."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her statement shirting evolved into cold shoulder shapes such as her popular Gabriella top, which sold 5,620 styles in the first year of introducing it to the market. Her Bardot dress – a short-sleeve, off-the-shoulder dress style with a flattering nipped-in waist – was equally successful, selling out on <a data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.stylebop.com/en-gb/women/#search:query=caroline+constas&group%5B0%5D=women&q=caroline+constas" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="online retailer Stylebop" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">online retailer Stylebop</a> within minutes of going live.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Aside from its pretty wanderlust appeal, Constas' USP comes from the cleverness and quality of the designs. For example, the Gabriella top comes with a built-in, stretch-mesh bustier top, which fits everyone and means you don't have to worry about the perils of a strapless bra.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"My philosophy is to put the product first," says Constas. "We do not cut corners, we invest in the best quality fabric, perform several fittings, sometimes up to seven just for one style to ensure the fit is perfect. I also think that being a lifestyle brand is a strength. I believe strongly in branding and telling a story. The story becomes as important as the product and together ensure the longevity of a brand."</p><img alt="Caroline Constas" title="Caroline Constas" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/harpersbazaaruk.cdnds.net/17/35/1504189431-constas.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Caroline Constas spring/summer 2017</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Next up for the brand is the launch of swimwear this November – something Constas feels passionately about having spent her childhood summers in Greece. She still holidays there every year.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I have always wanted to launch swim," she says of the collection, which will be called Caroline Constas Mer. "It has always been an emotional category for me, one which I relate to very much. I really thought about one thing and one thing only, what are the bathing suits that I want to wear that I can't find anywhere. And that's what I designed."</p><img alt="Caroline Constas" title="Caroline Constas" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/harpersbazaaruk.cdnds.net/17/35/1504189267-caroline-constas1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Caroline Constas autumn/winter 2017</span></p><img alt="Caroline Constas" title="Caroline Constas" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/harpersbazaaruk.cdnds.net/17/35/1504189556-rbw-pr-caroline-constas-aw17-lookbook-32.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Caroline Constas autumn/winter 2017</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There is definitely a sunshine weather appeal to Constas' brand, but that's not to say it doesn't work for cooler months. Statement shirting is at the heart of her new collection – Victoriana high-necked blouses with puff sleeves, her classic bare shoulder styles with beautiful ruffle sleeves, as well as Western cowboy incarnations for a more dressed-down look. There's also some great evening options, including a luxe-looking red silk wrap shirt.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But with such success comes numerous high street replicas. It's not something that concerns Constas, who is of the 'imitation is the highest form of flattery' mindset.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"You know, I think we are living in a time where everything is moving so quickly," she muses. "It's a compliment to see that your designs have that much of an influence on an industry and pioneered a certain look. If you are doing something right, it's inevitable not to experience this."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Constas has a clear, considered focus and is growing organically. The only way is up.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">...</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmSzor%2FHoqanZZ6axLR7wG1qbm1mZLWww4ycmKunnJ67pnnCqKWsrJGoeqS0wKeenpxdqbWmedaasGavlWKxs7HSrGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
