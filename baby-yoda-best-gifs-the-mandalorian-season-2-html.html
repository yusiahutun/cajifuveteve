We’re talking, of course, about the small, green, sleepy, broth-loving creature known officially as the Child — and then, once Mando had a fateful encounter with the Jedi Ahsoka Tano, <a href=#>as “Grogu”</a> — but unofficially by the much better name Baby Yoda. (For the sake of Disney not getting mad at us, we hereby acknowledge that the Child Grogu is not actually a young version of Yoda — the timeline <a href=#>doesn’t work out for that</a> — but he is a 50-year-old, and therefore quite infantile, member of the general Yoda species.) As we’ve gotten to know him better this season, we’ve learned that Baby Yoda is primarily a big fan of food, even when it means eating the eggs of a nice frog woman, and that his emotional connection with Mando might be a bad thing for his future, Jedi-wise.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cki4tju6h000u3g6larifq86l@published data-word-count=98>Last season, we devoted much of our coverage of The Mandalorian to focusing on just what happened with Yoda in <a href=#>each episode in adorable GIF form</a>, and this season, we’re back at it again. Obviously. When <a href=#>we left off</a>, Mando and Baby Yoda were off on an adventure to parts unknown to find others of Baby Yoda’s kind, with the creepy Moff Gideon trailing behind them. Will Mando learn better child-rearing skills this time around? Will the guild start a day-care program? Will Baby Yoda make friends with more <a href=#>quirky American comedian guest stars</a>? We can only hope.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgwbobbw000o3h6gg593jc80@published data-word-count=8>Spoilers ahead for season two of The Mandalorian.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckgw9umhe000c3h6are5ciqtd@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text><a data-vars-anchor-text="Chapter Nine: The Marshal" href=#>Chapter Nine: The Marshal</a></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/6f7/319/56d74fc750d9658bb297ddf68ba91070e2-baby-yoda-is-scared-of-graffiti-.rhorizontal.w700.gif><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgwa2n84000n3h6aboadgaee@published data-word-count=46>Mando’s first choice as a newly dedicated single parent is to take Baby Yoda to a fight club!

In his search for the other Mandalorians, Mando gets into a fight with Gor Koresh. Happily, Baby Yoda has learned some crucial self-preservation techniques, namely how to hit the button that shields him from blaster fire. Mando has also picked up one moderately responsible fighting skill: He kicks Baby Yoda’s closed-up pod away from the fray once the battle starts going. Responsible!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/def/1ff/afaef00a2464b520973074d524c00de262-amy-sedaris-baby-yoda.rhorizontal.w700.gif><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgwa4z20000e3h6aslwfisrx@published data-word-count=60>Mando discovers there may be a fellow Mandalorian on Tatooine.

(The character’s real name is Cobb Vanth, but let’s be real.) Mos Pelgos is also home to a giant, Dune-inspired sandworm called a krayt dragon. Baby Yoda is alerted to this fact by a dramatic earthquake.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/bee/4f0/857c6e32910c673515ca6c0e14bdf0c992-baby-yoda-peeks-out-of-pot.rhorizontal.w700.gif><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgwabbw4001h3h6al61e3290@published data-word-count=9>Good call hiding inside the big pot, Baby Yoda!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/21d/696/3d3da5299289c7d2d047b194042464ccd6-tuscan-raider-toothbrush.rhorizontal.w700.gif><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgwabhiz001m3h6abkf78sd6@published data-word-count=51>Mando and Timothy Olyphant, Salt-and-Pepper Marshall of Tatooine, make friends with some Raiders who are also interested in dispatching the krayt dragon.

Things go badly, of course — the plan to explode it from below doesn’t work, many Raiders die, and Salt-and-Pepper Marshall gets quite worried about how this is all going. In the exciting endgame of the battle, Mando grabs a bantha covered in explosives and lets the dragon swallow them all up! Baby Yoda is understandably worried about this. But fear not: Everyone makes it out all right. Except for that bantha covered in explosives, obviously. Anyway, there’s a creepy man watching them from the distance as the episode ends.

Ahsoka has some big news for Mando: She can communicate with Baby Yoda telepathically, and he has a name, which is Grogu! Gro-gu! Baby Yoda (sorry, this is still a more fun title than Grogu) acknowledges this <a href=#>pairing of random syllables</a> as his name by cooing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/67e/ef5/2e4a77e915dd54211131dad2b2bb5d0148-baby-yoda-catch.rhorizontal.w700.gif><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cki4qi0uu001x3h6aak1b6boq@published data-word-count=37>Once the naming is done, Ahsoka moves on to some training.

Mando steps in with the shiny ball, and suddenly Grogu is a lot more interested in playing. This is a sign of his immense potential but also, according to Ahsoka, a sign that he has too strong a connection with Mando and may be ruled by his emotions. She’s worried about the possibility of Grogu going Darth, so after Mando goes and helps out on a little mission, she suggests Grogu stop by a Jedi temple on Tython and choose his own path. We hope our Baby Yoda will choose the right one, though, knowing him, it will probably just be whatever path involves more snacks.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckiaecbi3000p3h6azktnvjnv@published><a data-vars-anchor-text="Chapter 14: The Tragedy" href=#>Chapter 14: The Tragedy</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/84d/36c/a6027a81f4c07df89b98fcbb4fe1097102-baby-yoda-activates-beacon.rhorizontal.w700.gif><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckiaeep01000t3h6a9z9ruxwd@published data-word-count=34>In order to find his true Jedi teacher, Mando plunks Grogu down on a very important Jedi rock.
