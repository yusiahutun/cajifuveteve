The <a href=#>National Library of Medicine</a> notes how rare and aggressive this form of cancer can be, adding that it's more commonly found in adolescents and young adults.</p><p>Robertson says the little girl needs a bone marrow transplant, adding that "it is her only chance at a cure." That followed Saturday's (Nov. 18)&nbsp;bone marrow drive for Meredith at the little girl's<a href=#> school of dance.</a> They share that she's being treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn.</p><p>Both Robertson and the Linda Lavender School of Dance emphasize that it's very easy and pain-free to find out if you're a match for Meredith, or someone else in need of a bone marrow transplant. <a href=#>Be the Match</a> notes that it's as easy as registering and swabbing your cheek. Adults between age 18 and 40 are eligible.</p><p>"Can we please see the good side of social media and find her a match?" Robertson asks.</p><p>You can also text FIGHT4NORAKAY to 61474 to get a swab kit.</p><p>Robertson grew up in Monroe, La., near where Meredith lives.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>R.I.P.: 27 Country Singers and Songwriters Who Died Too Soon</h2><p>These country singers had so much more to give.
