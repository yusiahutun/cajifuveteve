But one commentator doesn’t believe it will happen.</strong></p><p><a href=#>Meghan Markle’s</a> acting career spanned almost two decades. She starred most notably in the <a href=#>TV</a> show Suits, in which she portrayed Rachel Zane. Meghan was in the series for seven years, filming her finale episode in 2017. The following year she married her husband, <a href=#>Prince Harry</a>. The <a href=#>royal</a> couple then left The Firm in January 2020 as they said they wished to be “financially independent.” But now Meghan could return to her <a href=#>Hollywood</a> career back in a role that catapulted her to fame, though there are doubts over it happening.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-suits-reunion-with-meghan-markle-won-t-happen>Suits reunion with Meghan Markle ‘won’t happen’</h2><p>Talking on Sky News Australia, British journalist Esther Krakue said she believes a Suits reunion starring Meghan Markle “won’t happen.” This is because, Krakue claimed, the 42-year-old “probably wants to go more behind the scenes and do production work.”</p><p>She explained: “The original writer of Suits is pursuing a spinoff series, and there’s speculation Meghan would star in it.</p><p>“There’s a character written in there which is about a 30-year-old woman in California who’s smarter than everyone else, who’s killing it and having an amazing legal career.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Harry and Meghan pose with ‘TV bosses’ weeks after rumors of Duchess’ ‘Hollywood comeback’</a></p><p>“People are speculating that’s somehow a reference to Meghan, or that’s a role she would likely want to take up.”</p><p>She continued by saying she didn’t think the duchess would be working in front of the camera, but instead behind it – something Meghan has hinted at in the past.</p><p>She added: “There have been people saying that’s probably the best way for her to return to prominence, relevance, and Hollywood by starring in the show that made her famous in the first place. But actually, you’ve had members of the cast saying they don’t have her number, for example, they don’t know how to contact her.</p><p>“Her agency hasn’t said anything, they haven’t confirmed she’s wanting to go back into Hollywood as a working actress … They’ve remained tight-lipped. But I don’t suspect she’d want to go back into Hollywood in that way. I think she might want to be more behind-the-scenes and do production work.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-psychic-predicts-meghan-will-return-to-acting>Psychic predicts Meghan ‘will return to acting’</h2><p>Psychic Adam Norton told Celebrity Tidbit exclusively he believes Meghan Markle will return to her movie-making routes, but it might not be in the <a href=#>Suits</a> reunion. He said earlier this month he believes <a href=#>she will take on producing duties</a>, just as Krakue predicted.</p><p>He said: “I actually feel Meghan will return to work, so her career is about to take off in a different direction. I see some movie and acting work ahead for her, so definitely expect to see her on the big screen.</p><p>“Both behind and in front of the camera, so there’s some acting work she’ll be doing, but also a little bit of directing and behind-the-scenes action.”</p><p>Meghan Markle signed with William Morris Endeavor (WME) last year, a high profile Hollywood agency.</p><p><strong>MORE</strong>: <a href=#>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s success is a ‘ticking timebomb’, royal author says</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2eCcLnEoJ%2Bapl2irrO3y55kq52kqr%2Bvtc2gZK2nXZ28rbjYsKaonF2strW0jKysoqyjYr%2Bmwc2ipqdlmai7tXnGqKCnn12pvG60wKmnnqZf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
