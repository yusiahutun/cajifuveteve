Search &#34;country songs about fighting&#34; to find &#34;Fightin' Side of Me&#34; by Merle Haggard and &#34;I Could Kick Your A--&#34; by Justin Moore as two of the most surly. Comparing this new country-rocker to either doesn't quite feel right, as the tone is much more modern — think Brantley Gilbert in his drinking days."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Add to that Aldean's willingness to speak his mind and you get "Try That a Small Town," a song that is intended to be every bit the threat it sounds like.</p><h3>Listen to Jason Aldean, "Try That In a Small Town":</h3><h3>Jason Aldean, "Try That In a Small Town" Lyrics:</h3><p>(Writers: Kurt Allison, Tully Kennedy, Kelley Lovelace, Neil Thrasher)</p><p>Sucker punch somebody on a sidewalk / Carjack an old lady at a red light / Pull a gun on the owner of a liquor store / You think it’s cool, well act a fool if you like / Cuss out a cop, spit in his face / Stomp on the flag and light it up / Yeah, you think you’re tough.</p><p><strong>Chorus:</strong><br>Try that in a small town / See how far you make it down the road / Round here we take care of our own / You cross that line it won’t take long / For you to find out / I recommend you don’t / Try that in a small town.</p><p>Got a gun that my granddad gave me / They say one day they're gonna round up / That shit may fly in the city / Good luck trying that in a small town.</p><p><strong>Repeat Chorus</strong></p><p>Try that in a small town / Full of good ol’ boys / Raised up right / If you’re looking for a fight / Try that in a small town.</p><p><strong>Repeat Chorus</strong></p><a class="next-post cto" href=#>Next: Check Out This Month's Top 40 Country Songs</a><h2 class=photogallery-title>Top 50 Jason Aldean Songs: His Greatest Hits + Best Deep Cuts</h2>The best <a href=#>Jason Aldean</a> songs are spread out among his 11 studio albums. Find singles and deep cuts from his self-titled debut album high on this list, right alongside more recent hits and duets from Macon and Georgia.<p>Taste of Country asked readers for input and did a deep dive into Aldeans' full catalog of songs to identify those worthy of this top songs list, and those that simply aren't. Spoiler alert: A few radio singles are missing, and several album tracks rank inside the Top 20. Sales and chart success helped us round out the Top 50. Do you agree with No. 1?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo5mjpLturcudnJqmXam%2FunnToZitZZmjeqJ50qaYpaRdqby4uo4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
