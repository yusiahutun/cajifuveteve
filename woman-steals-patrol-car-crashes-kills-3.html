The responding deputy was told a woman, later identified as Kendra Boone, attempted to steal the car keys of another woman at the scene.</p><p>Bodycam video from the deputy shows the moment he pulled up to Boone, telling her to meet him at the rear of his vehicle. When he went around the back, she instead jumped into the open passenger's side window, before getting into the driver's seat and closing the door. The vehicle was still running.</p><p>The footage can be seen around the 1:30 mark below:</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Facebook Video.</p><p>Though the deputy was able to reopen the door, yelling at Boone to "stop," she pulled out of the parking lot and drove off -- with other responding officers on her trail.</p><p>According to the Mario County Sheriff's Office, while deputies were ready to use stop sticks to end the pursuit, she pulled a U-turn and drove off in the other direction at speeds "well over 100 MPH." At one point, she allegedly drove on the shoulder to pass a semi-truck and lost control of the vehicle while attempting to reenter the roadway. She then entered oncoming traffic and "collided with a black pickup truck."</p><p>Boone and three occupants of the truck were unresponsive when deputies arrived on the scene, where Boone and two of the occupants were pronounced dead. The third person was taken to the hospital.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:753219b7-0b6d-476c-b048-35e7bb62d5c9 data-container-ref=toofab:article:4529e61a-3d25-48f2-b06c-d16420cec085 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e8/5by4/2024/02/06/e89e761e936a4c2785e5c06b97b88802_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Food Network Star Duff Goldman Recovering from Head-On Collision, Serious Injury</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Speaking about the "tragic incident" at a press conference last week, Marion County Sheriff Billy Woods slammed the "moron" who stole the patrol vehicle and vehemently defended his own deputy for doing "absolutely nothing wrong."</p><p>When asked whether there was a policy regarding deputies leaving their cars running while responding to a scene, Woods went off.</p><p>"I have a feeling y'all gonna push my buttons.

He claimed she had 13 different felony charges in her life, as well as 9 misdemeanors, before praising Marion officials for getting her behind bars for two years previously. He said she should have still been in jail for violating probation when the crash occurred, criticizing nearby counties for not throwing the book at her for the violation. If they had, he said, two innocent people wouldn't be dead.</p><p>"Her, I don't give a crap about," he added.</p><p>"We didn't do anything wrong. What do you people not get?!" he exclaimed when another journalist asked whether there may be any policy changes in the future. "You want to put the blame somewhere else. The blame is on this Kendra Boone. Not a policy, not what my deputy did, on her. You wanna fix our problems in society? Hold people accountable."</p><p>He added that the deputy whose vehicle was stolen was still on active duty. The Florida Highway Patrol is investigating the fatal crash.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2tmaW9frLyurc1mqq2dkaHAbrzAramopF2YrrN5wquYrKCVqHqstculqmZrXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
