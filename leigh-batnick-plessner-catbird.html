How did you become a buyer?I studied English and anthropology as an undergraduate and I ended up becoming a buyer at a bookstore before I started working at Catbird. That was eight years ago when there were no rules, and then I became the buyer and general manager. It was a slow progression of adding beauty into our assortment and I think as my relationship with beauty products changed and as my personal interest grew I began bringing more products in and exploring more for us."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It was a slow progression of adding beauty into our assortment and I think as my relationship with beauty products changed and as my personal interest grew I began bringing more products in and exploring more for us.

Instagram is huge, I'll just go down a rabbit hole and find things to call in, but over time, we've been getting a lot more submissions from brands who want to be in the store. It's a big challenge to find something that's not mass market or widely available but still feels really complete from A to Z and not only is a beautiful product with a great name but with packaging that feels finished and special.</p><img alt="this image is not available" title="this image is not available" width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1643411268.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Media Platforms Design Team</span></p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What are you loving right now?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I love multipurpose productsâ€”so many of our beauty selections can be used in a variety of ways.

Every morning after I shower, I take a small scoop and warm it up in my hands and apply it to my arms and dÃ©colletage. The base is coconut oil so it's really moisturizing and the rose scent pairs beautifully with other perfumes. Also, we named it after a passage from Anne of Green Gables, which makes me really happy.
