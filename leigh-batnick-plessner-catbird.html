How did you become a buyer?I studied English and anthropology as an undergraduate and I ended up becoming a buyer at a bookstore before I started working at Catbird. That was eight years ago when there were no rules, and then I became the buyer and general manager. It was a slow progression of adding beauty into our assortment and I think as my relationship with beauty products changed and as my personal interest grew I began bringing more products in and exploring more for us."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It was a slow progression of adding beauty into our assortment and I think as my relationship with beauty products changed and as my personal interest grew I began bringing more products in and exploring more for us.

Instagram is huge, I'll just go down a rabbit hole and find things to call in, but over time, we've been getting a lot more submissions from brands who want to be in the store. It's a big challenge to find something that's not mass market or widely available but still feels really complete from A to Z and not only is a beautiful product with a great name but with packaging that feels finished and special.</p><img alt="this image is not available" title="this image is not available" width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1643411268.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Media Platforms Design Team</span></p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What are you loving right now?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I love multipurpose products—so many of our beauty selections can be used in a variety of ways.

Every morning after I shower, I take a small scoop and warm it up in my hands and apply it to my arms and décolletage. The base is coconut oil so it's really moisturizing and the rose scent pairs beautifully with other perfumes. Also, we named it after a passage from Anne of Green Gables, which makes me really happy.
