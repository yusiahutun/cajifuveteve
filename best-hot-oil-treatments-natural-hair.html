Hot oil treatments not only infuse your hair with tons of moisture, but also can add shine, strengthen, and even repair damage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Below, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Naté Bova</a>, hairstylist and founder of Naté Hair Care, explains everything you need to know about hot oil treatments, plus her go-to products.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-a-hot-oil-treatment></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is a Hot Oil Treatment?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A hot oil treatment consists of coating your hair with a nourishing oil (it could be a single oil or a blend) then, using either a heat cap or bonnet dryer, add heat to help the product soak into your strands.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The best time to do a hot oil treatment is during the colder months or when humidity is down as the hair may have a harder time retaining moisture," Bova explains.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-benefits-of-a-hot-oil-treatment></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Benefits of a Hot Oil Treatment</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hot oil treatments are great for injecting moisture and nutrients into your curls. The heat will open the cuticles of your hair shaft, allowing the oil to quickly penetrate into it. "Coarser hair types like [type] 3 and 4 [hair] can benefit from hot oil treatments — especially if you're looking for weight and curl definition," reveals Bova.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Your hair texture will help you determine what kind of oils you want to use for your hot oil treatment. And while you can purchase some already made concoctions, you can easily create a DIY hot oil treatment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Type 3 hair may require a lighter weight oil than type 4 hair," states Bova. "Type 3 isn't as coarse, so it will not need the weight type 4 [hair] would need for the oils to penetrate."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For finer hair, Bova recommends argan, jojoba, and grapeseed oils. "They have a smaller molecular size and can easily penetrate type 3 hair with lower porosity," she shares. While thicker, coarser hair may require coconut or castor oil.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-prepare-for-a-hot-oil-treatment></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Prepare for a Hot Oil Treatment</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before doing any type of hair treatment, you'll want to ensure that your hair is thoroughly cleansed and detangled.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Start off by using a clarifying shampoo, then a light conditioner that will help you comb out knots in the shower, without weighing your hair down.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-best-products-for-a-hot-oil-treatment></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Best Products for a Hot Oil Treatment</span></h2><span class=heading-toc id=toc-okay-pure-naturals-almond-hot-oil-treatment></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Okay Pure Naturals Almond Hot Oil Treatment</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Okay Pure Naturals</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you have type 3 hair, Bova suggests trying Okay Pure Naturals Almond Hot Oil Treatment.

Starting on clean hair allows the shampoo to wash away any product build-up to facilitate the oil penetrating into your hair strands.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Step Two:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Divide the hair into four sections — it's easier to manage the hair and apply the hot oil treatment this way. Then, coat each section thoroughly.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Step Three:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Start at the bottom sections applying the oil to the hands first and smooth down from the scalp to the ends and comb through thoroughly [and] repeat on the remaining sections, " explains Bova. You can also opt to finger-comb your hair to distribute the product.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Step Four:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now it's time for the heat to help the hot oil penetrate your hair cuticles. "Cover your head with a shower cap or bonnet and sit under a hood dryer," states Bova. If you don't have a hooded dryer, you can improvise. "Use a diffuser to warm the entire area of your head for 15-20 minutes," shares Bova.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Step Five:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rinse thoroughly and style as usual. Is your hair feeling extra dry? Bova recommends, "If you feel like your hair could use a longer conditioning time you can leave the oils in overnight and rinse in the morning."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Voilà!
