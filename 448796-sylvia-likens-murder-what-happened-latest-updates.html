She was born on January 3rd, 1949, in Lebanon, Indiana, United States. Her parents were Lester Cecil Likens and Elizabeth Frances.</p><p class=align-left>She was the third child, born between two sets of fraternal twins siblings. The first twins, Daniel and Dianna, were two years older than her, while Benny and Jenny were one year younger. Jenny Likens suffered from Polio, and as a result, one of her legs was weaker than the other.</p><h2>Sylvia Likens murder incident</h2><p class=align-left>Is Sylvia Likens still alive? No, she died on October 26th, 1965. Her murder is the most enduring nightmare in Indianapolis True Crime history. So, what happened to the little girl?</p><p class=align-left>Sylvia Likens' parents experienced financial stress while they raised their five children. They often sold candy, beer, and soda at carnival stands around Indiana throughout the <a href=#>summer</a>. As a result, they moved frequently.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/bb8099f842a0ca7f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kaynette Williams: Here's what happened to Blake Shelton's ex-wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In 1965, things took a different direction after Sylvia's mother was arrested and jailed for shoplifting. Lester Cecil Likens arranged for his daughters to stay with Getrude Baniszewski. She was the mother of Paula and Stephanie Baniszewski. The two girls had become friends with Sylvia and Jenny.</p><p class=align-left>Lester <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">agreed to pay weekly</a> fees of $20 to Getrude. However, because of financial strain, the fee began to wane, leaving Getrude frustrated. She would then channel the frustration towards the two girls, abusing and caning them.</p><p class=align-left>By August, the beatings exceeded a dozen a week, often for issues like eating too much food. Sylvia was also accused of prostitution and spreading rumours about the Baniszewskis. Even though the rumours were unfound, everyone began turning on the little girl.</p><p class=align-left>Two neighbourhood kids, Coy Hubbard and Richard Hobb, were also involved in the mess. By the end of the summer, Sylvia was being raped, starved, verbally tormented, and assaulted with objects physically and sexually. The <a href=#>family</a> forbade Sylvia from attending school, and she was held captive.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/12aa27019e1c27f6.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Felicia Forbes: The story of Tommy 'Tiny' Lister's wife</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9b2998d34f16639c.png><p class=align-left>When Getrude realised Sylvia might be dying, she forced her to write a note saying a gang of boys beat her. According to her plan, she was to blindfold her and dump her in nearby woods with the note. But when Sylvia tried to escape, Gertrude and one of the boys stopped and beat her. It was at that point that her malnourished body collapsed, and she died.</p><h2>What did Richard Hobbs do to Sylvia Likens?</h2><p class=align-left>Richard was a neighbourhood kid. He was also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">involved in physically abusing</a> Sylvia. He performed the infamous act of helping carve the words, “I am a prostitute and proud of it” into Sylvia's stomach.</p><p class=align-left>The actor was done using a large needle. Getrude started it, and when she got tired, Richard took over to finish the task.</p><h2>What happened to Sylvia's younger sister?</h2><p class=align-left>Jenny <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">did not suffer</a> as much abuse as her sister Sylvia did, probably because Polio had crippled her. Nevertheless, she was occasionally forced to participate in Sylvia's torture by being intimidated. She had opportunities to tell neighbours what was going on but failed to do so because she feared it would worsen things.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/63a99ed75b32af00.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bryan Callen: divorce story, wife, net worth, latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Jenny was a crucial witness in the murder case of her sister. She revealed that each of the five defendants had repeatedly and extensively abused Sylvia. She added that Sylvia had done nothing to provoke the assaults.</p><p class=align-left>While testifying, Jenny burst into tears as she recalled how, days before Sylvia died, she had talked to her about death. She had said:</p>Jenny, I know you don't want me to die, but I am going to die. I can tell it!<p class=align-left>Jenny died on June 23th, 2004, in Marion County, Florida, United States. She passed away at the age of 54 years.</p><h2>What happened to Sylvia Likens parents?</h2><p class=align-left>Sylvia's parents had a tumultuous <a href=#>marriage</a> and were always on and off. Her father worked hard to ensure that his children had a roof over their heads. He was a loving father who kept his children by her side.</p><p class=align-left>Jenny described Elizabeth as a good mother, even though she left them behind with the horrific Mrs Baniszewski. After the murder of her daughter, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Elizabeth felt guilty</a>, and she struggled to testify due to grief. She felt that she could not be forgiven after leaving her daughters behind with a cold-blooded killer.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/79906f3403a94856.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Cynthia Morgan biography: boyfriend, sickness, net worth, what happened, latest pictures</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Later, Lester and Elizabeth divorced. Elizabeth remarried and died in 1998 at the age of 71. Lester also died in 2013.</p><h2>Sylvia Likens' murder trial and sentencing</h2><p class=align-left>The autopsy of Sylvia's body revealed she had suffered more than 150 separate wounds. She was also emaciated at the time of her death. On December 30th, 1965, Gertrude Baniszewski, two of her three oldest children, Richard Hobbs and Coy Hubbard, were indicted.</p><p class=align-left>They were <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">arraigned before Judge Rabb</a> at Indianapolis' City-County Building. Gertrude denied any knowledge of the torture. She claimed the children must have done it all. She entered pleas of not guilty and not guilty because of insanity.</p><p class=align-left>Baniszewski was found guilty of first-degree murder at the end of the trial. Her daughter Paula was found guilty of second-degree murder. Hobbs and Coy, along with Gertrude's son John were convicted of manslaughter.</p><p class=align-left>Paula and her mother were sentenced to life terms at the Indiana Women's Prison in Indianapolis. The boys were handed two-to-21-year terms at the Indiana State Reformatory in Pendleton. However, in 1971, Gertrude and Paula were granted a new trial due to a "prejudicial atmosphere".</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b8671de3591cff46.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Samantha Lewes: Tom Hanks' divorce story and her cause of death</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Gertrude was again convicted of first-degree murder. Her daughter pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter and served about two years in prison. The three boys were released on parole for good behaviour in 1968.</p><h2>Where are Getrude Baniszewski and her family now?</h2><p class=align-left>Mrs Baniszewski was also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">released from prison</a> on parole in December 1985. She moved to Iowa and changed her name to Nadine Van Fossan. She lived there in obscurity until her death on June 16th, 1990. She succumbed to lung cancer.</p><p class=align-left>Paula got married and moved to a farm in Iowa. She secured a new identity and a job at an elementary school. Her brother, John, became a minister in Texas and counselled children of divorced parents. One of the neighbourhood kids, Robb, died of cancer four years after being released.</p><h2>Sylvia Likens documentary on Netflix</h2><p class=align-left>The true story of Gertrude, who kept Sylvia locked in the basement of her home, was captured in a documentary titled <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">An American Crime</a>.</i> The film was produced in 2007, and its director is Tommy O'Haver.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/32203621e792eeee.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The life and career of Debbe Dunning</span></p></a><h2>Quick facts about Sylvia Likens</h2><li>How old was Sylvia Likens when she died?
