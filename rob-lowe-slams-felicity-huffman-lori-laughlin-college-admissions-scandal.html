Among the elites accused of participating in it were&nbsp;Desperate Housewives actress <a href=#><strong>Felicity Huffman</strong></a>, who was <a href=#>reportedly arrested at gunpoint</a>, and Full House actress <a href=#><strong>Lori Loughlin</strong></a>.</p><p>Felicity, 56, allegedly “made a purported charitable contribution of $15,000 … to participate in the college entrance exam cheating scheme on behalf of her eldest daughter [Sofia Grace Macy, 18].” Documents also allege that she “later made arrangements to pursue the scheme a second time, for her younger daughter [Georgia Grace Macy, 16], before deciding not to do so.” Felicity shares both daughters with longtime husband <strong>William H. Macy</strong>, who has avoided charges thus far.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/felicity-huffman-lori-loughlin-e1553811221804.jpg><p>As for Lori — who shares daughters Isabella Rose Giannulli, 20, and Olivia Jade Giannulli, 19, with fashion designer husband <strong>Mossimo Giannulli</strong> — the 54-year-old is accused of having “agreed to pay bribes totaling $500,000 in exchange for having their two daughters designated as recruits to the USC crew team — despite the fact that they did not participate in crew — thereby facilitating their admission to USC.” Lori and Mossimo have both been charged for their alleged involvement.</p><p>Rob isn’t the only celeb who spoke out. Dawson’s Creek star <strong>James Van Der Beek</strong> poked fun at the scheme’s name, Operation Varsity Blues, <a href=#>on Twitter</a>. The 42-year-old actor, who has left the tweet up, appeared in the 1999’s Varsity Blues.</p><p>This story continues to develop …</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46rpptlnKTEpnnSpZimq12bsq21wqKrsmWYqrOnucCnZKWnop56ra3UoJ%2BloZ5isLC4y56enmWRmbqqv9KipqerXaiworrDmqNo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
