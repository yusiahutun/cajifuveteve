The high rebates offered by agents show the impact of a persistent downward trend in the city’s property sector.
Total property transactions for the whole of 2023 are expected to fall to a 33-year low, reaching around the 58,000 mark, according to a recent statement from Centaline Property Agency."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But the October figure was still far below the 2,100 transactions recorded in March, according to Midland Realty.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Midland and Centaline are involved in nearly 90 per cent of all property transactions in Hong Kong, the world’s most expensive real estate market.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/19/e94d5719-5aac-42df-9eee-db443fe1398d_4dc085ca.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Property agents are highly competitive, so they tend to use high rebates from their commission fees as a means to capture more business,” said Kelvin Wong Siu-kei, director of Real Estate Lab at the University of Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There are 40,013 property agents in Hong Kong as of October 31, according to the Estate Agents Authority.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is a very tough market now, as transaction volumes and prices are dropping,” said Victoria Allan, founder and managing director of luxury property agency Habitat Property. “Agency commissions are down, too.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Allan indicated that agencies such as Centaline and Midland, which have hundreds of offices and thousands of employees, are probably trying to increase their commissions.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Midland Realty faces Hong Kong legal action for alleged sales commission fixing</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The commission accused Midland and two subsidiaries of directing agents to charge a minimum net commission rate of 2 per cent for first-hand residential properties starting on January 1. The net commission rate is what property developers pay to real estate agencies after deducting their expenses, such as rebates.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The watchdog said Midland had conspired with arch-rival Centaline and its subsidiary Ricacorp Properties, which were granted leniency in exchange for “fully cooperating” with the investigation and “providing substantial assistance”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The regulator said fixing or restricting the rate effectively altered the final price of properties and contravened the Competition Ordinance.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That case, according to Real Estate Lab’s Wong, has also put a spotlight on the rebate system used by property agents to land deals.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong developers back Midland Realty despite commission fixing scandal</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The rebate system, according to various industry experts, gradually developed and became an established practice in 2013, when the Residential Properties (First-hand Sales) Ordinance (Cap 621) came into effect on April 29 that year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The ordinance regulates the sale of first-hand, uncompleted and completed residential properties, according to the Sales of First-hand Residential Properties Authority. It sets out detailed requirements for vendors of first-hand residential property to comply with, in relation to sales brochures, price lists, disclosure of transaction information and sales arrangements.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The price list of a new project launch, for example, is required to be made available at least three days before the date of sale. Any change in the listed price of a specified residential property must be reflected in the revision to such a list, according to the ordinance.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Experts, however, have called for a review of the ordinance, including the regulation concerning price lists.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/19/5e84090a-9750-4fa9-95f8-697f340a7856_b38b7c99.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Rebates serve as a price-adjustment tool for developers under [existing] regulation,” said Joseph Tsang, chairman of real estate services firm JLL Hong Kong. “And this has always been the case even when the [property] market was at its peak.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When sentiment in the property market was good, developers created a record for high price per square foot so that some units can be put on the market at a later date and get sold at a higher price, according to Tsang. That way, agents can receive higher commission fees, giving them the flexibility to push rebates to homebuyers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When the market sentiment is lukewarm, Tsang said developers are typically reluctant to reduce their prices, which will be reflected in the property’s price list. He indicated that this is used to measure the level of rebates agents can offer homebuyers.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong home prices to fall by 10 per cent in 2024, UBS forecasts</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Before 2013, the typical practice in the market was for prospective homebuyers to negotiate a property’s price directly with the developer, according to Real Estate Lab’s Wong. There was no requirement to release price lists, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Property agents, according to Wong, are like lubricants between developers and homebuyers. He said agents, under the current regulations, help the developer adjust the property prices through rebates, as developers are restricted from directly negotiating the price with buyers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The ordinance has been effective in regulating and scrutinising the quality of properties, and make property information transparent,” Wong said. “But the rebate system also disrupts market information because the property’s real price can’t be [fully] determined, which is detrimental to the interest of buyers.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kr7a%2FyKecrKtflr%2B1tcKlnGhrYml%2FcYOYaJ%2BoppdiuLC6xmanq6egmr%2B1xYyhprBlmJ60qXnRnpmarJWoeqK%2BxGafnqSgnruoecOerZ6kn6Wys7%2BMpayrnV2ivLOxjKGmpp2SqsamvtJmmKahlGLArcHGoKCsoF2irrO3xK0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
