It often lacks radiance, can be dry, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>rough, and bumpy</a>, and shows the wear, tear, and stress caused by my hectic life. Not to mention marks and discoloration from continued breakouts that I thought should have dissipated 20-plus years ago. Now that summer has arrived, I’ve been seeking a way to give my skin some life and a natural glow without having to spend time under the sun’s damaging rays, and one brightening face scrub is delivering those results in under 10 minutes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When I received the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Minimo Glow Turmeric Face Scrub</a> in Lemon Cake to try out two weeks ago, I was eager to find out if it could deliver on its promise to even out skin tone, fade discoloration and signs of acne, and brighten skin like its name indicates. And true to form, the face scrub gently exfoliates with its natural ingredients to reveal a healthy layer of radiant skin. And right now, you can get on sale at Amazon.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>$30 (Originally $32); <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">amazon.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">exfoliating scrub</a> can be used up to two times daily — and works best with consistent use — so I started by exfoliating once a day in the morning on clean skin. I scooped a small, quarter-sized amount from the jar, and began massaging it over my cheeks, chin (where I have the most discoloration), forehead, and nose in small circular motions. My initial reaction was toward the scrub’s incredible Lemon Cake scent, which is honestly so deliciously reminiscent of homemade gingerbread cookies I could have taken a bite. I applied the scrub in the shower after using cleanser, then carried on with my regular routine since it can be left on for up to 10 minutes. The sugar dissolves a bit on damp skin, leaving behind a creamy mask.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After washing it off, I did my usual skin touch test and couldn’t believe how soft and smooth it felt after just one use — even on my bumpy forehead. When I looked at my complexion, it had a natural-looking sun-kissed glow and maintained its soft feel when dried. Since the initial use, I’ve upped to a twice-daily process whenever time allows. It’s been two weeks with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Minimo Glow face scrub</a>, and I’ve found a significant improvement in my skin’s discoloration left behind from old and new breakouts along with small age spots and uneven tone that worsen in the summer sun. It also leaves me with a smooth, youthful glow and brighter skin that I’ve been missing for years.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To get these results, the Minimo Glow scrub is formulated with natural ingredients that work together to soothe, smooth, and reveal healthy skin. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>antioxidant turmeric</a> provides the glowy benefit and evens out complexion, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>raw manuka honey</a> hydrates and soothes reactive skin, organic cinnamon also contributes to a more even tone, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>chamomile</a> calms irritated skin and provides a youthful glow, and pure cane sugar scrubs away dead skin cells.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Amazon shoppers have found similar results, with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">one person sharing</a> that their “skin feels softer and smoother and looks brighter” when using the scrub as a mask. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">Another reviewer</a> said that after using the scrub their “face is glowing,” and they also found the added benefit of “undereye dark circles lightening up” after just two uses.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">My soft, bright, and evenly glowing skin with minimal discoloration is in better shape than in my youth thanks to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Minimo Glow turmeric face scrub</a>.
