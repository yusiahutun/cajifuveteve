His unique home originally went on the market in November of 2020 for $349,900, and at the time, the house was in need of some serious updates.</p><p>It sold for that price the following month, and the luxurious residence has since been completely renovated and updated. The brick house features wood, tile and carpeted floors throughout, and there are a total of four fireplaces, two living rooms, two dining rooms, two breakfast nooks and two laundry rooms. The property also features a safe room, and it's situated on 20 wooded acres in a very private setting that's also nearby the historic Jack Daniel's distillery.</p><p>Other features of the ornate home include a spiral staircase that leads to a bonus room above the master bedroom, an office, a two-car garage and more.</p><p><a href=#>Lisa Cole</a> at <a href=#>Baker & Cole Properties, LLC</a>, and <a href=#>Jason Galaz</a> at <a href=#>eXp Realty</a> hold the <a href=#>listing</a>.
