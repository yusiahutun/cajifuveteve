The Las Vegas mother whose son was found stuffed in the freezer of the home she was held captive in had been desperately plotting her escape for weeks, her lawyer has claimed.
The woman's lawyer Stephen Stubbs described her horrific ordeal to People, starting from the death of her beloved husband last year, to the moment she finally managed to flee his allegedly abusive replacement."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Relatives became worried after seeing how disrespectful Toseland was at a family gathering.</p><p>"He methodically and systematically just started exercising more and more control over her," Stubbs said. "So the family expressed concern, [and] then they kind of started withdrawing from family a little bit."</p><p>Toseland became more and more paranoid and possessive, the attorney claims, confiscating her phone and texting her family abusive messages from it, and quit her job.</p><p>He put locks on bedroom doorknobs, installed motion sensors in the home, and even watched her whenever she used the bathroom, the attorney said; She was forced to cook and clean, and was tied up with duct tape whenever she wasn't.</p><p>Whenever she was allowed ride in the car with him, she was handcuffed, he said.</p><p>It was during one of these captive car rides that she first spotted a sticky note pad and pen; thus began a weeks-long plan to seek help.</p><p>Taking whatever opportunities she could find, in the brief moments she was left alone, she would quickly write S.O.S. notes and hide them in her clothing — hoping Toseland would never see them — and slipping them under her mattress when she returned to the house.</p><p>"Help! I'm being held captive," one note read, per Stubbs. "Call my mom," said another. "He has a gun. Be careful."</p><p>"She thought of situations: 'What if I had a chance to give a note to a mailman, or a stranger or a pizza man," the attorney added.</p><p>That opportunity arose on February 20 when Toseland — for some unknown reason — made the unusual move of allowing the mother to sleep with her daughter.</p><p>Having observed him, the mom knew there was only one other place he wasn't searching besides under the mattress cover: her daughter's socks.</p><p>"That's when she coached her daughter about what to do and how important it was that [Toseland] didn't know about this and everything else," Stubbs said.</p><p>That Tuesday morning, as her daughter was getting ready to go to school, she told her: "Put this note in your sock, under your feet to hide in your shoe."</p><p>The seven-year-old did her part, and delivered the note to a teacher. Police were notified; they waited for the car to leave the home and pulled Toseland over for a traffic violation.</p><p>"That's when it was over," Stubbs said.</p><p>"She's heroic," he added. "For her to be in that situation and try to pay attention to the details and come up with a plan — this was done over weeks. And just looking for a flaw. And when she identified a flaw, she exploited it with the small acts of rebellion to take her power back, whatever little power she could take."</p><p>Toseland appeared in court Monday, charged with two counts of first-degree kidnapping and one count of open murder. No plea was entered. A bail hearing is set for April.</p><p class="divider-block__text divider-block__stroke-color-secondary">original story: 2/23/2022 3:54 PM pst</p><p>A little girl handed her teacher a chilling note in a Las Vegas school on Tuesday — which ultimately led to the discovery of her little brother's body stuffed in a freezer.</p><p>Just before 8:40 AM, LVMPD were notified that an elementary student had arrived with a note from her mother claiming she was being held against her will at a home on Saddle Brook Park Drive.</p><p>The mom had also written that she did not know the whereabouts of her son — and that she believed the child was possibly dead.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:bdb61418-b070-48d2-a1a5-6a62b826d83b data-container-ref=toofab:article:f9186f17-c5f1-428b-95dc-f0f62f1b49e4 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/9f/5by4/2022/02/22/9f55c309ed0d46c6b7941e75638c4257_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">FOX 2 Detroit</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">5-Year-Old Detroit Boy Shot Multiple Times in the Face 'Execution-Style' Alongside Parents; Two Teens Arrested</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Officers immediately descended on the home where they found the mother, and arrested her boyfriend, 35-year-old Brandon Toseland.</p><p>The woman told detectives she was being abused by Toseland for months, and that she was not allowed to leave the house alone, or enter the garage.
