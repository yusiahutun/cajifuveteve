Bangs can give your hairstyle added dimension and frame your face better than a Picasso piece in the MET Museum. Nevertheless, curly girls sometimes hesitate with this hairstyle — it's not the same as having straight bangs (nor is the method to achieve the look).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Some misconceptions that clients have are curly bangs are only for children, or bangs don't look good on adults, or even that they always look frizzy," shares hairstylist<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1> Monae Everett</a>, who has given stars like Taraji P. Henson and Yara Shahidi their red carpet hairstyles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>>> Enhance and Define</strong>: Who says you can't have curl definition and volume? Curlsmith's Bouncy Strength Volume Foam Hair Mousse enhances curls without weighing them down. For voluminous curls, Jaimee Smith, Senior Manager of Service and Education at JCPenney, recommends starting with soaking wet hair after conditioning. Apply foam from root to ends, saturating and defining each curl. Need a little more drama? Smith recommends applying additional product to the roots for a touch more volume. Available at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>The Salon by InStyle inside JCPenney</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sponsored by JCPenney</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Thankfully, curly bangs work on all types of coils ranging from wavy to the tightest of textures. However, before you head to the salon or even try your hand at a DIY bang job (pro tip: don't do it!), there are several things you need to know about curly bangs. Should you cut your bangs wet or dry? Does the shape of your face matter? What about shrinkage?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For answers to all your questions, we asked Everett and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Larry Sims</a>, celebrity hairstylist and co-founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Flawless by Gabrielle Union</a>, to give us the 411 on this hairstyle — so you can not only pull off curly bangs, but thrive with this look!</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-getting-curly-bangs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Are the Pros and Cons Of Getting Curly Bangs?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Sims, curly bangs always give off a stylish vibe, no matter what hairstyle you have. "You can rock your hair down, in a ponytail or even in a messy top knot with a curly bang and it will be a vibe," says the stylist. Everett adds that curly bangs are also a great way to change the shape of your haircut.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are endless options for achieving curly bangs. Just like straight hair, you can have shaggy bangs, curtain bangs, feathered bangs, and more. However, Everett's personal favorite shape for curly bangs are full or voluminous.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I love when curly peeps use the volume in their bangs to give additional lift on the top of their head." Take Yara Shahidi's hair at the 51st NAACP Image Awards as an example.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Frazer Harrison/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you are on the fence about getting curly bangs or not sure where to start, Everett suggests beginning with wispy bangs. "This way you can decide if you love the look and want to add more hair to your bangs for a voluminous look, or keep the bangs wispy so that you can blend them back into your hair."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But, there is a little problem you may run into if you ever decide to blow out your hair, says Sims. "When you straighten your hair, your bangs may be too long to hit above your eyelids which can be a con, depending on what length you cut them," explains the stylist.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-should-natural-hair-be-cut-wet-or-dry></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Should Natural Hair Be Cut Wet or Dry?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Curly hair has shrinkage and everyone experiences it differently. Some prefer to have their hair cut wet, while others prefer for it to be done dry. And although you may blow out your hair when you are getting a trim, this is a no-no for curly bangs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Everett shares a non-negotiable when it comes to this look: "Always cut bangs far longer than you believe you want them to be and cut your bangs when your hair is in its curly state."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In other words, start slow with your bang process! Also, keep in mind that cutting them when your hair is curly will allow you to see the true shape of the look versus cutting them when your hair is blown out straight.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Taraji P. Henson Just Debuted Chic Eye-Grazing Bangs</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-do-curly-bangs-work-for-all-textures></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Do Curly Bangs Work for All Textures?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Yep, all hair textures can get curly bangs. But Everett highlights that type 4 hair "can enjoy multiple types of bangs." The kinky-curly texture allows a glorious array of looks achieved in multiple ways and opportunities to create faux bangs if you aren't ready to permanently cut your hair into that shape.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I love to see bangs created from twist outs or having longer hair pinned into bangs from afro puffs and other updos," states Everett. Even your afro can get an update with bangs. "Picked out 'fros also look amazing with rounded or curtain bangs to frame the face," states Everett.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-whats-the-best-length-to-cut-curly-bangs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What's the Best Length to Cut Curly Bangs?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Depending on your curl type, Sims says it's usually best to cut curly bangs at the tip of the nose but no shorter than the bridge. "Bangs cut above the bridge of the nose tend to be too short when they revert and dry," he explains.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-do-i-need-to-know-about-styling-and-maintaining-for-curly-bangs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Do I Need to Know About Styling and Maintaining For Curly Bangs?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You have curly bangs…now what? Beautiful bangs start with using products to keep your hair hydrated, so it's important to create a hair regimen that ensures your bangs remain moisturized and frizz-free. "You want to make sure your curly bangs are always moisturized, luscious, and defined," says Sims. "I like using the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Flawless by Gabrielle Union Defining Curl Cream</a> to help elongate curls while maintaining a touchable hold without the crunch. Smashed curly bangs don't work at all."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I always start any curly style on wet hair," reveals Everett. Begin the process with a leave-in conditioner that has moisturizing properties. <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Taliah Waajid Shea-Coco Condition Daily Leave-In Conditioner</a> is great, as the shea butter and coconut oil combo add moisture to hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The easiest way to style curly bangs is to rake the products through the curls and layer with a curl cream, gel, or mousse," the stylist continues. Just make sure to use your fingers to layer the product to minimize frizz. "Finger coil each curl and either let air dry or defuse dry," Everett suggests. Try <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus Frizz Free Curl Mousse</a>, the formula contains neem oil, which prevents frizz, as well as silk protein for soft curls.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And if you have type 4 hair, here's a tip. "I'd twist or braid the hair if I wanted a more defined curl pattern." After the curls dry, loosen the hair by adding a serum to your finger trips to separate and shake out the coils. She likes the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Sebastian Professional Dark Oil</a>. "The serum will break the caste of the products used to set the curls, along with adding shine and reducing frizz."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For hair that doesn't have a defined curl pattern or in need of even more moisture, Everett uses the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Ouidad Coil Infusion Good Shape Defining Gel</a> after adding the leave-in conditioner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Finally, to minimize manipulation and prevent breakage while keeping the curly bangs frizz-free and defined, it's all about how you take care of your bangs after hours. "I'd loosely pin the bangs back into the rest of the hair, while gathering that hair into a high pineapple then cover with a satin scarf or bonnet. In the morning, remove pins and shake the hair out," says Everett. A great option to loosen next day hair of all textures is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Carol's Daughter Hair Milk Refresher Spray</a>. It's blended with agave and shea butter to lock in moisture and make your hair shine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is All Natural.
