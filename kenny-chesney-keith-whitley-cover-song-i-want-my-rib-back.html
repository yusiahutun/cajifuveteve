This holds steadfast when it comes to Chesney's career.
This year marks the 30th anniversary of Chesney's debut album, In My Wildest Dreams, which was released in April of 1994. That project featured &#34;The Tin Man&#34; as a radio hit, but it also had a song that was written and recorded by Keith Whitley, &#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

His ultra-lavish mansion in Bel Air, Calif., an estate called Lionsgate, was opulent even by celebrity standards. The 11-bedroom, 17-bathroom home totals 23,988 square feet of space, and it sits on 1.63 acres of some of the most expensive real estate in California.</p><p>The lavish interior includes a master suite that encompasses more than 3,000 square feet, three separate living rooms, seven fireplaces, a billiards room, a formal study, a private 12-seat theater with leather seats, a climate-controlled wine room that opens onto a saltwater pool, three steam showers and a large dry sauna. The property also features an&nbsp;outdoor glass elevator that leads to a large ballroom party space with an attached guest suite and a professional-sized gym.</p>The exterior of the house is just as lavish, including an outdoor living area with heated floors and a fully equipped bar, a tennis court with stadium lighting and a viewing area, a hot tub and extensive landscaping.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Realtor.com</a>&nbsp;calls Lionsgate the "most prestigious luxury estate" in Bel Air, boasting "possibly the best views in Los Angeles."According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>, Rogers purchased the estate in the 1970s, and he added the lions to the gate and christened the home Lionsgate. He sold it in 1983 for $5.8 million, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, and the property most recently sold in 2015 for a staggering $46.25 million.<p class=photogallery-credit>Gallery Credit: <a href=#>Sterling Whitaker</a></p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Here Are Keith Whitley's Top 10 Songs</h2><a href=#>Keith Whitley died&nbsp;</a>on May 9, 1989, but his music lives on. The traditional country singer's smooth baritone-tenor marks his best songs from a&nbsp;half-decade worth of records and many more years' worth of proper romanticizing. Whitley is perhaps more cherished by the current generation of country stars than he was at the time of his death, leading to his induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame as a member of the Class of 2022.<p>Radio hits, an under-appreciated album cut, a vintage cover song and one fine duet mark this list of the Top 10 Keith Whitley songs.</p><p class=photogallery-credit>Gallery Credit: <a href=#>Sterling Whitaker</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpJ2eo8Zur8eeqqedqWK4prXToWSwoJmpuabFjJymr52iYsCwusZmoGavkaPBbrnYZqmiml2XrqS3jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
