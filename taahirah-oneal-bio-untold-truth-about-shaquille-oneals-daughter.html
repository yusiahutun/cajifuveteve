Shaq’s daughter, Taahirah O’Neal, turns out to be academically gifted and has managed to build up quite an impressive CV herself.</p><p>Taahira’s relationship with Shaquille seems to be a pleasant one; the former center clearly loves her and, although she appears in his social media posts now and then, it is his actions that have proved his love for her.</p><p>Taahirah, a recent college graduate, loves her father just as much and also posts photos of him on social media. She often remembers him with pictures of him on his birthdays and other days.</p><p>Shak is also of a good father because he is always there for his children – he makes sure he never misses out on any of their achievements. Now that he’s retired from his playing career, the 7.1-inch-tall Shaq values his family above all else. Find out more about the father-daughter relationship in more detail below, dominated by Taahirah O’Neill.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Taahirah O’Neal Is A Florida-Born</strong></h2><p>Taahirah O’Neal, the first child of Shaquille O’Neal and his ex-wife Arnette Jardburg, was born on 19 July 1996 in Orlando, Florida.</p><p>However, now 25 years old, Taahira grew up mostly in Texas.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Taahirah O’Neal Graduated Top Of Her Class; Her Father Made A Speech At The Ceremony</strong></h2><p>Taahira graduated <a href=# rel=noopener>cum laude from Oglethorpe University</a> in 2019 with a BA in Sociology and an MA in Politics and African Studies.</p><p>In fact, when she graduated from Oglethorpe University with the highest GPA, her former NBA star father flew all the way to Atlanta to attend the ceremony.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Shaq also gave a speech and also joked about being just an average student, calling himself a “Never cum laude” student! Lucille O’Neill’s granddaughter, Taahirah, also showed the graduation ceremony on TNT’s reality series Shaq Life.</p><p>In one of the episode’s clips, shared on TNT’s YouTube page, Shaq can be seen arriving at Oglethorpe University’s campus in Atlanta to celebrate his first-year student’s achievement. Taahirah’s educational achievement is reportedly due to her and her father’s shared passion for education.</p><p>The current sports analyst himself returned to school after dropping out of Louisiana State University and heading to the NBA. Upon his return, Shaq earned a Bachelor’s, Master’s, and Doctorate in Education.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Meet Pitbull’s Daughter Destiny Pérez: Her Mother, Boyfriend, & More</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Taahirah Works At Pepsi</strong></h2><p>Shaq’s eldest daughter, Taahirah, currently works for PepsiCo. as a social media/communications analyst. She is also a part-time social media assistant at her father’s entertainment company, Mine O Mine, according to her <a href=# rel=noopener>LinkedIn</a>.</p><p>In addition, she is passionate about philanthropy and the concept of helping those in need. Taahirah supports several charities and sponsors a project that raises awareness among young people.</p><p>She additionally encourages them to get involved in philanthropy. Taahira has apparently partnered with non-profit organizations such as The Trevor Project, Texas Children’s Hospital, and Black Women’s Health Imperative to try and make a difference.</p><p>The daughter of a former NBA champion is also leading another such project, Pepsi’s Stronger Together initiative. Most of her philanthropic activities are carried out in Texas, where she lives.</p><p>Taahirah has been open in interviews that despite their closeness, she wants to live outside her father’s big shadow. She has also expressed that she always hopes that his success does not determine what her success will be. However, Taahirahh admits that although she would not want her parents’ success to overshadow hers, she is lucky to have had them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Taahirah’s Mother Is A Businesswoman; Her Parents’ Relationship</strong></h2><p>Well, Taahirahh O’Neill’s mother and Shaq’s first wife, Arnett Yardburg, is a businesswoman and, like her daughter, she is a philanthropist who also grew up in Houston, Texas.</p><p>Florida-born Taahirah’s parents, Arnett and Shaq, started their relationship in 1992.</p><p>The former couple was close to marriage until their relationship ended abruptly when Arnett refused to sign a prenuptial agreement.</p><p>Although they parted ways, Arnett and Shaquille continued to raise their daughter Taahirah together. She lives most of the time with her mother in Houston, Texas.</p><p>However, she does not neglect her father either, as she is very present in his life. The Oglethorpe University graduate follows him and supports his every endeavor. As Taahirah supports all things charitably, she also supports social events and charities under her father’s guidance.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Taahirah O’Neal’s Father, Shaq O’Neal’s Married His Wife</strong></h2><p>After breaking up with Taahirahh’s mother Arnett, Shaq O’Neal married reality show star, Shawnee O’Neal. They married in 2002 and divorced nine years later, in 2011. While still husband and wife, Shaq and Shaunie became parents to four children, Sharif, Amira, Shakir, and Meira.</p><p>Shaq’s ex-wife Shaunie also has a son, Miles, from a previous relationship, whom the New York-born Shaq raised as his own after starting a relationship with Shaunie. Three-time Finals MVP, Shaquille, and Shaunie divorced in 2009, but maintain a close relationship, trying to raise their children peacefully together.</p><p>In an interview, Shaquille revealed that it was his divorce from his ex-wife, Shaunie O’Neal, that was to blame. He said that “everything” was his fault because he “did not protect her”. According to Shaunie, Shaq is said to have met actress Annie Ilonzeh of ABC’s daytime soap opera General Hospital. However, it is not clear whether Ilionzeh is still Shaq’s girlfriend.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Taahirah O’Neal Has Five Siblings</strong></h2><p>Although Taahira is the only child of Shaq and his ex-wife Arnett, she has quite a few siblings from her father’s second marriage to Shaun O’Neal. Because of Shaq and his ex-wife Shaunie O’Neal, Taahirah has half-sisters Shareef, Amirah, Shaqir, and Me’arah.</p><p>She is also the stepmother of her father’s ex-wife Mailes, Shaunie’s son from her own previous relationship. Tahir’s half-brother Shareef is also a professional basketball player who played at Louisiana State University until 2022. Before that, he played for the University of California, Los Angeles during the 2019-20 season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Taahirah-ONeal-Siblings.jpg><p>Shaq’s daughter with Shaun, Amira O’Neal, is also a college athlete who plays basketball at Texas Southern University. Taahirah’s other half-brother, Shakir O’Neal, is also a basketball player who plays for TSU.</p><p>Shaunie and Shaq’s other daughter, Me’arah O’Neal, is a high school student who already has offers from colleges such as UCLA, TCU, University of Virginia, and Howard University, according to her Instagram. Shak’s adopted son, Miles, is an entertainer, musician, and model who has been gracing TV screens and walking runways since childhood.</p><p>This step-brother of Taahirahh’s stepfather first appeared on his mother’s reality show Basketball Wives in 2010.</p><p>The 21-year-old, 21-foot-3-inch Miles is also believed to have made his fashion debut when he walked the Dolce & Gabbana Spring 2018 runway show during Milan Fashion Week.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Is Taahirah O’Neal Going To Inherit From Shaq’s Net Worth?</strong></h2><p>While Taahirah’s father, Shaquille O’Neal, may have made business moves that have given him a net worth of USD 400 million, this does not mean that his <a href=# rel=noopener>children will automatically get the keys</a> to this vast fortune.</p><p>And that is probably also true for Tahir. Shaq has made it clear in several interviews that he makes his children work hard to earn money. He has also told them that just because he is rich does not mean that they are rich too.</p><p>Speaking about his decision with Atlanta’s Black Star magazine in July 2021, the 36-year-old former LA Lakers player said,</p><p>“My kids are older now. They kinda upset with me. Not really upset, but they don’t understand. I tell them all the time. We ain’t rich. I’m rich.”</p><p>The legendary basketball player has no plans to share his wealth with his children and has stated that they have to work hard themselves.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Taahirah O’Neal Might Become Rich On One Condition</strong></h2><p>However, the NBA Hall of Famer has said that if his children want financial support from him, they must be prepared to abide by the code of ethics and lifestyle he sets for them.</p><p>And if the former Miami Heat player’s children do not respect his views, they will receive nothing.</p><p>Shaq said in an interview that his children have to have a bachelor’s or a master’s [degree], and if they want their father to invest in one of their companies, they will have to present it: ‘Boom boom boom, bring it to me. My New Jersey-born father has said that education should be compulsory.</p><p>And he obviously does not care what their professions are. Fortunately, Shaquille O’Neill’s children, especially Taahirah, seem to be holding their own when it comes to their professional lives. Taahira’s father, Mr. O’Neill, was fabulously wealthy when he retired from basketball.</p><p>And over the years, his net worth has only grown thanks to his business dealings. Sources agree that Shaq’s net worth in 2022 will exceed USD 400 million. In addition to his investments, he probably earns a salary of around USD 60 million annually, which is excluded from his endorsement deals.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Shaq Has Allowed His Daughter, Taahirah To Remain At His House As Long As She Wants</strong></h2><p>Taahirah, according to Shaq himself, can stay with her former NBA father as long as she wants. The father of six revealed this in an interview with The Pivot Podcast in April 2022.</p><p>In fact, this rule applies to all his daughters, but not to his sons. In a conversation on The Pivot Podcast, Taahirahh’s father discussed how he is lenient with his three daughters, but not with his three sons.</p><p>As for his sons, Shaq said that they leave on their own when they turn 18, but his daughters do not have a deadline to leave home. The Sacramento Kings owner says his girls like it a little better. This rule does not apply to his sons because he believes that as a man his sons should protect, provide for, and love their women.</p><p>“You know how boys are. My boys, you bring something in front of them, and they’re gone. I tell my boys when y’all get 18 you all got to go. Girls can stay as long as they want.</p><p>Said the 1992 first-round draft pick.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Elva Dornan: The Truth About Jamie Dornan’s Daughter</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Does Taahirah O’Neal Have A Boyfriend?</strong></h2><p>Although it is not clear who she is seeing at the moment, there is a little story behind this Taahira question. Back in January 2020, her father Shaq had spoken about the dating rule for his daughters.</p><p>In an interview with US Weekly, the former Orlando Magic player revealed that his daughters, including Taahirah, have age restrictions on relationships. At the time, he said:</p><p>“My daughters can’t date till they’re like 25.”</p><p>Shaquille also added that he was sure that none of his daughters had broken this rule. Although now that Taahirah is 25, it is no less a thriller as to who her boyfriend/partner is and whether she even has one.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Is Taahirah On Social Media?</strong></h2><p>Although almost all of Taahirah’s half-siblings are on columns like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and others, the magna cum laude itself is rather uncommunicative when it comes to similar gatherings. Although, as already mentioned, Taahirah often participates in her father’s and siblings’ social activities.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Taahirah O’Neal Other Facts</strong></h2><p>In 2017, Shaquille threw his daughter Taahirah a lavish birthday party. On his 21st birthday, the Olympic champion threw Taahirah a white birthday party at Life HTX in Montrose.</p><p>While all the guests wore white, Taahira was the center of attention, wearing a black dress by Houston designer Chloe Dao, winner of Project Runway Season 2.</p><p>In March 2022, Taahira’s father, Shaquille O’Neal, revealed that he suffers from sleep apnoea and that his life is in danger due to this serious sleep disorder.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Quick Facts About Taahirah O’Neal</strong></h2><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody readability=2.5><tr><th>Full Name:</th><td>Taahirah 0’Neal</td></tr><tr><th>Born Date:</th><td>18 Jul, 1996</td></tr><tr><th>Age:</th><td>26 years</td></tr><tr><th>Horoscope:</th><td>Cancer</td></tr><tr><th>Lucky Number:</th><td>5</td></tr><tr><th>Lucky Stone:</th><td>Moonstone</td></tr><tr><th>Lucky Color:</th><td>Silver</td></tr><tr><th>Best Match for Marriage:</th><td>Taurus, Pisces, Scorpio</td></tr><tr><th>Gender:</th><td>Female</td></tr><tr><th>Profession:</th><td>Celebrity Kid</td></tr><tr><th>Country:</th><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><th>Marital Status:</th><td>single</td></tr><tr><th>Net Worth</th><td>$3 Million</td></tr><tr><th>Eye Color</th><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><th>Hair Color</th><td>Black</td></tr><tr><th>Birth Place</th><td>Orlando, Florida</td></tr><tr><th>Nationality</th><td>American</td></tr><tr><th>Education</th><td>Oglethorpe University</td></tr><tr><th>Father</th><td>Shaquille O’Neal</td></tr><tr><th>Mother</th><td>Arnetta Yardbourgh</td></tr><tr readability=5><th>Siblings</th><td>Shareef, Shaqir, Amirah, and Me’arah</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kwaKtx6KpmqBdpLumrctmmaKnXaq7tbvLnWStqqWptW6twaisrWWjna6ywcilo55ln6OyorjSZpuarZedwaa%2Bjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
