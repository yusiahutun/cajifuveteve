Some even joked that Luckett, Roberson, and Franklin had been “voted off the island,” just like an episode of Survivor.</p><p id=par-6_30>Rather than let the ongoing criticism and drama get her down, Beyoncé decided to turn the negativity into something positive, resulting in her coming up with the lyrics for Survivor.</p><p id=par-7_79>“Beyoncé was tired of people talking about the Destiny’s Child members changing asking, who was going to be the last one to survive?” Williams told <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a> in 2016. “As the new member, I was being protective over the girls because I was just starting to know them. There are member changes in groups all the time. Things happen. I believe in the journey Destiny’s Child had to take to fulfill the group’s mission: to continue to empower everybody.”</p><h2>The ‘Survivor’ theme continued with the music video</h2><p id=par-8_19>Shot in January 2001, the music video for Survivor premiered on MTV’s Making the Video on March 6, 2001.</p><p id=par-9_21>The video opens up with Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland, and Michelle Williams washing up on a beach “somewhere in the South Pacific.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-10_43>During Making the Video, fans got to go behind the scenes and see how Survivor came to be — how it was filmed at Point Dume State Beach in Malibu, California, and how the group drew inspiration from the Survivor series’ deserted-island premise.</p><p id=par-11_23>While many people loved everything about the song and music video, some thought the track was aimed at Destiny’s Child’s former group members.</p><p id=par-12_35>It was soon revealed that Luckett and Roberson weren’t pleased with the track, which they believed violated an agreement that prevented group members from making “any public comment of a disparaging nature concerning one another.”</p><p id=par-13_34>As a result, the singers filed a lawsuit against Destiny’s Child and Sony Music, even though Beyoncé claimed the song was not directed toward anyone. The suit was eventually <a href=#>settled</a> a few months later.</p><h2>‘Survivor’ is one of Destiny’s Child’s most successful singles of all time</h2><p id=par-14_29>Though there was a ton of drama behind the making and the release of Survivor, the song still went on to become Destiny’s Child most successful track to date.</p><p id=par-15_48>Not only did it debut at number 43 on the Hot 100 in February of 2001 and quickly climb to the No. 2 spot on the music chart, but it also won the Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 2002 Grammy Awards.</p><p id=par-16_27>Today, Survivor is still Destiny’s Child’s second highest-debuting single and currently holds a spot on Billboard’s list of 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxpr%2FToqWyq12Ytaq4w6xkrKeenHq0wdGvoK%2BnomLEor%2BMmpqtrZGhubp5yKeqqaGimrFurthmq6GdXZ22tXnRnpiloaSueqS7zKmcraGknryvedKeqaKdo2O1tbnLaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
