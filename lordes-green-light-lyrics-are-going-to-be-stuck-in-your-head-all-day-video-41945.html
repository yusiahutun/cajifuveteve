The upbeat track is reminiscent of Tori Amos, and has a super catchy chorus. In other words, the <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>lyrics to Lorde's "Green Light"</a> are going to be stuck in your head all day. With an unpredictable rhythm and a filmic video that takes us to a night club, Lorde's new single is reintroducing the performer to the world in the best way. This is an exciting and surprising new direction for the "Royals" singer.</p><p>Fans have been waiting a long time for new music from Lorde, and this single has definitely been worth the wait. It feels as though the New Zealand singer is trying out a new aesthetic with this release, as the song is a powerful dance track that would be perfect to listen to at festival. As catchy as a <a href=# class=T3D>Taylor Swift song, "Green Light"</a> takes us on a journey, or several journeys at once — on a night out, through a failing relationship, via the feelings we have about ourselves, and the people who make our lives what they are. So, what exactly are the <a href=# class=T3D>lyrics of Lorde's "Green Light"</a> about?</p><p></p><p>In the beginning, she sings,</p>"I do my makeup in somebody else's carWe order different drinks at the same barsI know about what you did and I wanna scream the truthShe thinks you love the beachYou're such a damn liar"<p>From the outset, Lorde's lyrics are relatable. <a href=# class=T3D>"Green Light" references another person</a>, a liar, and the speaker who knows the truth about them. The frustration felt throughout the song, of knowing a secret, but being unable to say anything, is so important. It's about the lies people tell in relationships, and what that does to the everyone else around you.</p>"Those great whites, they have big teethOh, they bite youThought you said that you would always be in loveBut you're not in love no moreDid it frighten you?How we kissed when we danced on the light up floorOn the light up floor"<p>When you think about it, there is <a href=# class=T3D>so much happening in "Green Light."</a> References to sharks tie into the idea of a "liar," or a person pretending to be something they're not. And it definitely sounds as if the "liar" used to be a love interest, before they left with someone else.</p>"But I hear sounds in my mindBrand new sounds in my mindBut honey I'll, be seein' you, ever, I goBut honey I'll, be seein' you down every road"<p>Despite whatever happened between them, she's essentially saying some people are inescapable. Lorde continues,</p>"I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it'Cause, honey, I'll come get my things, but I can't let goI'm waiting for it, that green light, I want itOh, I wish I could get my things and just let goI'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it"<p>If I had to sum it up, "Green Light" is about that moment when you know you have to leave, collect your things, move out, but you're paralyzed by the thought of it. Even though it's the right decision, you're waiting for a sign — for the perfect time — to let go.</p>"Sometimes I wake up in a different bedroomI whisper things, the city sings 'em back to youAll those rumors, they have big teethOh they bite youThought you said that you would always be in loveBut you're not in love no more"<p>The lyrics move on from sharks to rumors, which also have big teeth and can destroy a person. By the end, "Green Light" comes full circle, the relationship is over and the only thing that's still the same is the city.</p><p>I can't wait to hear the rest of Lorde's new album, delve into these new ideas and sounds, and find out the rest of the story.
