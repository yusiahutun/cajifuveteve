But I'm not an actor, man," Rucker tells Taste of Country Nights.</p><p>But when&nbsp;asked if he would do an episode of&nbsp;<a href=#>Yellowstone</a>, he was excited at the prospect.</p><p>"In a heartbeat. If Yellowstone called, I would pay for my own plane flight and hotel room — and they don't have to pay me — and I would be on that show," he says. "I love that show so bad. I love that show."</p><p>It's apparent&nbsp;Rucker has thought about this before.
