"Even Rhea won four for ", he quipped.&nbsp;</p><p id=e1hEtjlAWcT data-wc=37>Despite their separation, the couple have stayed close.

"This speaks to the strong bond they have built over their long marriage and as parents to their three children."</p><p id=eBCPJ80Z_2j data-wc=64>"While it isn’t always easy for couples to maintain a friendly relationship after divorce or separation, it shows that Danny and Rhea had a deep connection that they felt was worth sustaining despite deciding to go their separate ways after 30 years of marriage. When this is done for the right reasons, it’s a testament to the purity of the love for one another."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/47c0ec7a5b66-danny-devito-rhea-perlman.jpg><p id=e156e2UNvk data-wc=31>She continued: "Sometimes, a romantic connection between two people can change over time and fizzle out, but it doesn't always mean that the love and care for each other is gone."</p><p id=eOApHqd9_ek data-wc=48>"In cases like Danny and Rhea, they had 40 years of history together, and that bond can continue to exist even after their marriage has ended. Some couples can find a way to move past the hurt and disappointment of a failed marriage and maintain a strong friendship."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/94ff7328ae8e-gettyimages-1585120549.jpg><p id=eeXXqpMLW6 data-wc=15>In fact Rhea has spoken about how difficult it was to reconcile after their separation.</p><p id=eJBuVTeIfat data-wc=67>Speaking to Julia Louis-Dreyfus on her Wiser Than Me podcast, the Barbie actress revealed: "I'm not going to like sugarcoat it, it was difficult. It was very difficult at first. There were a lot of reasons as to why we separated, which I'm not going to go into. But it took time for us to come to this somehow pretty decent understanding and relationship with each other."</p><p id=eG9Flbb4Jgj data-wc=38>Louella added that "their appearance at the Emmys together speaks volumes about their love for each other as people rather than just ex-spouses. It's admirable that they continue to support each other in different aspects of their lives."</p><p id=eu2CsrpQ9CL data-wc=60>This backs up another thing that Rhea confirmed on the podcast, which is that: "Danny and I have always loved each other.
