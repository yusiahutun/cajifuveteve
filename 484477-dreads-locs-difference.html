So, what does each word mean in contemporary society?</p><h2>What are dreadlocks?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/90dd562f658d1a9f.jpg><p class=align-left>Dreadlocks are an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">excellent style</a> that involves backcombing, braiding, or rolling without much effort to finish the strands. Therefore, when an individual prefers to wear dreadlocks, they must be ready to undergo a <a href=#>styling process</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Everything starts with combing the strands of hair into a rope-like structure. And you can create different types of dreadlocks depending on how you do this procedure.</p><p class=align-left>Evidence shows that people have been rocking this style since ancient days. So, where did dreadlocks originate?</p><p class=align-left>Some sources claim that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dreadlocks originated</a> from Egypt, while others state that the style has some Greek origins. There is even another hypothesis that states Indians were the first culture to wear dreadlocks. Unfortunately, this theory does not have empirical evidence.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6ae6aefc19bc97c4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Karen haircut: What is it and why should you avoid it?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The most substantial theory with credible evidence is of Egyptian origin. A French Egyptologist discovered the remains of a mummy tightly glued on a dreadlock wig dating back to 1400 BCE. This evidence indicates that the dreadlocks style has its roots in Egypt.</p><p class=align-left>On top of this, the Old Testament recounts the tale of Samson and Delilah, whereby a man's potency is linked to "the seven locks on his head." Also, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Roman accounts</a>, the celts possessed "hair like snakes." Greeks and Vikings are also said to have worn dreadlocks.</p><p class=align-left>On the other hand, Rastafarians started <a href=#>wearing dreadlocks</a> for a different reason. Everything started in the 1930s when Ras Tafari was crowned the emperor of Ethiopia. However, he was forced into exile during an invasion, and the guerrilla warriors swore not to cut their hair until he was reinstated. And that is how the Rastafari religion started and resonated with the day's ideologies.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs3ntmhtg5atc.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>60 messy hairstyles for men trending in 2020</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Dreadlocks became famous because of reggae music and the influences of one of the best, Bob Marley. He wore dreadlocks himself and created immense interest in the style globally. He also popularized the Rastafarian culture.</p><h2>What are locs?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ecd91901c144e81f.jpeg><p class=align-left>Since the terms are used interchangeably, it is hard to distinguish between them. Locs are visually like dreads. The hairstyle is of African-Nubian descent and looks like a rope. So, why are they called locs, not dreads?</p><p class=align-left>Locs undergo the same locking process as dreads, albeit slightly different. One of the essential things for locs is the pleasing after-effect or polished appearance. The buttoning stage is a second process that gives the hairstyle its unique appearance.</p><p class=align-left>The tighter the hair, the better and faster the hair will lock. One of the most significant differences between dreads and locs is that with locs, you can see the roots of the hair strands, while you cannot see anything with dreads.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c8171740444f9650.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kush Tracey: 10 hottest photos you should check out</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Locs are hard to remove, considering the installation style, as one needs to unlock the hair, which is more challenging than plain braiding. Considering it is a polished style, people usually decorate locs with beads, different colours and other accessories.</p><h2>Dreads vs locs – what is the difference?</h2><p class=align-left>The term “locs and dreadlocks difference" has been widely searched as people try to get facts before going to the salon. You are likely still trying to understand the two hairstyles from the abovementioned definitions. So, what is the primary distinction between the two popular hairstyles?</p><p class=align-left>The most notable difference between locs and dreads is that one is a hairstyle while the other is a lifestyle. It would be best to remember that locs are cultivated, but dreadlocks are not. Dreadlocks often stem from the Rastafarian religion and beliefs.</p><p class=align-left>There is also a physical difference between the two hairstyles. If you have noticed, the <a href=#>loc hairstyle</a> comes out cleaner and prettier than dreadlocks that appear more relaxed and somewhat fuzzy. Dreads have a more natural appearance, while locs are polished and shiny. Locs have more defined roots, while dreads don’t.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a2163fcc1d57ab73.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Different types of dreads with pictures</span></p></a><p class=align-left>On top of the physical and cultural differences, people use the terms interchangeably. According to history, colonialists found the natural hairstyle dreadful, which led to the term dreadlocks. People these days prefer to refer to the phrase as locs. Therefore, they might mean dreads or locs.</p><h2>Dreadlocks history in slavery</h2><p class=align-left>Aside from the general confusion between dreads and locs, there is a negative connotation. People tend to utilize locs, staying away from the word dreadlocks because it has a negative sense.</p><p class=align-left>Many believe the term dreadlocks originated from the slave trade era when Africans lacked resources to groom their hair, forming the strands referred to as dreads. Their hair would get locked since the long voyages didn't allow them to carry out customary grooming rituals.</p><p class=align-left>Because of their rope-like nature, the enslavers would refer to the hair as dreadful. It was later referred to as dreadlocks. Therefore, people would like to avoid the term because of its <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">painful history</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0901db7742eb4bac.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 20 short dreadlocks styles to try out this year</span></p></a><h2>What do Jamaicans call dreadlocks?</h2><p class=align-left>While the rest of the <a href=#>world</a> uses the term dreads or locs, Jamaicans add another phrase to make it suit their culture. They use the term nutty dreadlock. The country has a rich Rastafarian culture, and people who conform to the religion wear dreadlocks, hence the "nutty" phrase.</p><h2>Are dreadlocks cultural appropriation?</h2><p class=align-left>Dreadlocks are seen as a form of cultural appropriation when worn by Caucasian people because of their deep connection to African culture. Scholarly research shows that dreadlocks were worn as a symbol of black resistance. Therefore, when worn by white people as a trendy hairstyle, it is a perception that colonizers are being blasé about adopting a hairstyle that is an expression of resistance.</p><p class=align-left>The dreads vs locs battle has been going on for quite some time, as the terms are used interchangeably. The most significant difference is that one is a hairstyle while the other is a lifestyle. There are also some physical differences between the two, like outspoken roots in locs, which are absent in dreads.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5557399f880194ca.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Effective ways on how to remove dreadlocks buildup</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Are you looking for the best<a href=#> butterfly locs</a> with colours to rock in 2022?
