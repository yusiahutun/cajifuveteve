"So that was something that was stirring around in my head, how to make it fresh and different, and I kind of knew at the end of 'Creed' that I wanted to have a daughter."</p><p>The "Black Panther" star recalled attending a screening for his 2019 drama, "Just Mercy," which was hosted by Bryant, who also shared daughters Natalia, 20, Bianka, 6, and Capri, 3, with wife Vanessa Bryant.</p><p>"We were on the 'Just Mercy' tour and Kobe Bryant hosted a screening. And [Jordan's 'Just Mercy' co-star] Jamie Foxx has a strong relationship with his daughter, who was into basketball, she was playing basketball," Jordan told Indiewire. "And Kobe's sitting there talking about Gianna and basketball and the Mamba Academy and everything."</p><p>"I just remember stepping out of myself for a second, and I'm looking at these guys that I have real admiration for and hearing them talk about their daughters," said. "I was like, 'Man, I'm pulling from all of this right now for the movie. I wanted to honor these kinds of relationships and what it means to be a girl dad."</p><p>"Creed II" -- which marks the directorial debut for Jordan -- sees Adonis Creed going head to head against his childhood friend (<a href=#>Jonathan Majors</a>), who resurfaced after years in prison. The film also finds Creed and his wife Bianca (<a href=#>Tessa Thompson</a>) raising their daughter, Amara, who was born deaf.</p><p>According to Indiewire, "Creed III" integrates ASL, with Jordan's scenes with his on-screen daughter (played by Mila Davis-Kent) featuring ASL subtitles. During his interview with the outlet, Jordan opened up about his decision to use ASL for the film's portrayal of deaf characters.</p><p>"It's great because [the films] evolved that way," he said. "I had the ability to really just drop them in this world and see how the ASL family is living and let the audience go for a ride."</p><a id=gallery-link-fc784634-2eef-4ef6-842e-87cd82b9d7e3 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:fc784634-2eef-4ef6-842e-87cd82b9d7e3 data-poster-image-ref=toofab:image-asset:image_jpg_20230228_dfbde23cda074891bdbc66c892a2db29 data-start-at-poster data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:5e184d50-3c36-488b-9bb6-3692048d2940 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/df/4by3/2023/02/28/dfbde23cda074891bdbc66c892a2db29_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2xmaWtforaktMCeo2aaXZ%2B8s7DAp2Skp5KaeqO%2B2JqlrWWXnq6vusBmoKeroJ6%2FprCMnKmenZRitqq1jJ2YnWWipLmmew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
