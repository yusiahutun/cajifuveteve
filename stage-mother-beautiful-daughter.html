And yet, as a new mother of a sweet little girl, I see the temptation. I find myself doting over the elegance in my infant's cheeks, thinking about the kind of life implied by beauty—or its absence.</p><img alt="Text, Font, Carmine, Coquelicot, " title="Text, Font, Carmine, Coquelicot, " width=2000 height=2010 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/beautiful-daughter-pq-01-1496777090.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">.</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gertrude Temple was always thinking about how her daughter’s dimpled cheeks and rounded limbs would appear. She began the project of forming an ideal Shirley when her daughter was still in the womb. In her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/Child-Star-Shirley-Temple-Black/dp/0070055327 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=memoir data-vars-ga-product-id=29926215-4817-4e0d-8990-99b3003393c3 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/Child-Star-Shirley-Temple-Black/dp/0070055327 data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/Child-Star-Shirley-Temple-Black/dp/0070055327 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/Child-Star-Shirley-Temple-Black/dp/0070055327 data-affiliate-network='{"id":"7f0216f7-084f-4dc8-9190-07ae7162064c","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=72990951-c18a-42e9-b3a0-cdd05c35f80c class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">memoir</a>, Temple tells a story about her pregnant mother consuming great artworks and spectacular views in the belief that these visual pleasures could somehow imprint themselves directly on her child. More than this, Gertrude was savvy and knew context mattered. Reportedly, Shirley’s mother would not allow her daughter to appear in photographs alongside other children, lest someone look at the picture and find another child more adorable than her little girl.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I would never think to characterize my feelings this way, yet I too feel the pull to rank my child. I gave birth in close step with my peers—that predictable span of five years following a spate of weddings during our twenties. In addition to camaraderie, this generational clustering of babies opened the door for comparison.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">Watch: <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/scoutfashion/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Scout Fashion's" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Scout Fashion's</a> Sai De Silva weighs in on how to raise a beautiful daughter...<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With my own daughter’s loveliness confirmed by repeat compliments from both friends and strangers, I can see myself taking a caretaker's attitude toward my daughter’s beauty that would horrify my hippy mother who dressed her own girls in the ubiquitous Oshkosh overalls and striped tees of the 1980s. Sometimes I feel like a farmer sitting on a vein of shale. As a feminist, there’s a part of me who wishes to keep this beauty in the ground, to not invest our family’s labors and daughter’s attentions in the cultivation of this natural resource. There’s also something that reads as tacky and too close to my middle class beginnings about the pageant and cheerleading circuit. Better to be too good to exploit the beauty of little girls.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And yet, I feel this niggling sense that it would be a shame to leave her beauty underground, untapped. Though I find myself dressing the baby practically for daycare—we joke that a particularly plain grey and blue outfit is part of our Bolshevik rejection of fashion—I also feel the yen of a potential, as-yet unrealized superiority. I see little girls dressed in patent leather shoes and matching skirt and sweater sets and think that were I only playing this game, my daughter’s obvious beauty would come into even starker relief.</p><img alt="Kitchen utensil, Cutlery, Drawing, " title="Kitchen utensil, Cutlery, Drawing, " width=364 height=552 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/shirley-temple-gif-v2-1495059483.gif?crop=1xw:1xh;center" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When I feel especially guilty about putting her in a stained but close-at-hand jacket, I picture Gertrude pinning baby Shirley between her knees as she administers each of the famous fifty-six curls, a ritual simultaneously loving and militant in its cultivation of her daughter’s beauty. I think less about the time she tried to fashion a retainer from a champagne cork’s cage for the thumb-sucking star.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s on this thin line between effortful shaping and loving attention that I find myself navigating motherhood. And I worry: In a society that so values female beauty am I wasting my daughter’s chances? At what point is a heavier intervention in a child’s appearance smoothing the path through adolescence? How to negotiate a space between the moms of Jon Benet Ramsey and Stephen King’s Carrie White? Right now I reassure myself it’s okay to tell my daughter she’s “so stinking cute” because she’s still a baby. I bargain, when she’s talking more, I promise to say only things like, “great science experiment;” or “good job helping your soccer team.” These are the little white lies mothers of daughters tell themselves all the time, I suspect.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There’s a scene in Shirley Temple’s breakout Fox film Stand up and Cheer (1934) in which the father character sings, “I’m presenting her right now. Baby, take a bow.” In a polka-dotted dress, little Shirley pops out from between his legs, bows, and blows a kiss to the audience. I find the line and performance chilling—a reminder that a girl in public is always, to a certain degree, presented—on display. And I’m faced with the ugly sense that “coming out” happens much earlier than 16.</p><img alt="Text, Font, Line, " title="Text, Font, Line, " width=2000 height=2242 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/beautiful-daughter-pq-02-1496777164.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">.</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The film, which brought Temple to national attention, works on the conceit that FDR wants performing artists to boost Depression-era American spirits, thereby goosing the economic outlook and bringing the nation out of its slump. To do so, he hires a Broadway producer whose main strategy is to offer the nation images of girlish beauty. Detailing his plan, another character explains that the producer is “always on the look out for lovely girls.” To which another responds, “well, who isn’t?”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s a demand upon girls that Gertrude traversed with savvy and that catches me up whenever I let it. Am I always “presenting” my daughter?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I suspect the answer is yes. Is it only class snobbery that separates my occasional fishing for Facebook likes when I post an especially cute picture of my daughter (it’s for her grandparents, I tell myself) from the pageant circuit that’s moved online? Thinking about Temple and my own girl, I scroll through the websites Elite Beauty USA and America’s Baby Doll Beauty USA; there is an infant on one page wearing full contouring makeup that enlarges her already big eyes and her turned up tiny nose. A “sweet treat” reads one photo description. Exhibition and exploitation seem painfully linked in an era where selfies are the norm and sexting scandals have become banal.</p><img alt="People, Photograph, Face, Child, Snapshot, Photography, Selfie, Happy, Black-and-white, Smile, " title="People, Photograph, Face, Child, Snapshot, Photography, Selfie, Happy, Black-and-white, Smile, " width=2000 height=2200 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/daughter-2-1495141598.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">.</span><p>The author pictured with her husband and daughter.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But, as a student of history, I know the presentation of children on social media is not so far from Temple’s famous “Good Ship Lollypop” performance, in which the actress is handed, doll-like from one adoring adult man to another. It was this blend of prurience and purity in the staging of Temple’s performances that led author Graham Greene to his infamous 1937 review of <span></span>Wee Willie Winkie: “Infancy with her is a disguise, her appeal is more secret and more adult. Already two years ago she was a fancy little piece.” He went on to describe the benefits of the masquerade for adult spectators: “Her admirers—middle aged men and clergymen—respond to her dubious coquetry, to the sight of her well-shaped and desirable little body, packed with enormous vitality, only because the safety curtain of story and dialogue drops between their intelligence and their desire.” For these candid observations, Fox Studio punished the novelist with a libel suit. I can’t help but wonder about the mothers who post their own “fancy little pieces” to the online pageants, as well as who might be looking at what I tell myself are innocent snapshots on Facebook—evidence that I too have absorbed the sense of physical beauty as something to document, a precious commodity always slipping away.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the pageant circuit that hopes to breed future Temples or Disney cast members, there’s a world of mothers (and fathers) whose approval is tied to the broader cultural endorsement of the commodity that is their daughters’ appearance. In her work on child beauty contests, clinician Martina Cartwright coins the term “princess by proxy” to describe a particular breed of stage mothers whose desire to achieve via their offspring overcomes the “<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567(12)00601-6/abstract data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="propensity to protect their children" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">propensity to protect their children</a>." It’s such harmful attitudes toward childhood beauty and the risk of sexualizing their youth that have led the French Senate to ban beauty pageants for children under the age of 16.</p><img alt="Text, Font, Line, " title="Text, Font, Line, " width=2000 height=2512 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/beautiful-daughter-pq-03-1496777248.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">.</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Concerns about beautiful children can seem like humble bragging, especially since researchers have generally found that attractive people benefit from a “halo effect” in which they are assumed to hold other positive attributes. And, moreover, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://doi-org.unr.idm.oclc.org/10.2466/pr0.1999.85.1.32 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10575972" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="those who are seen as less physically attractive" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">those who are seen as less physically attractive</a> are seen as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="http://unr.idm.oclc.org/login?url=http://search.proquest.com.unr.idm.oclc.org/docview/1695832297?accountid=452" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="less likely to be victimized" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">less likely to be victimized</a> by, and more responsible for crimes, such as sexual assault. But at the same time, tendencies to attribute all good things to the beautiful means that upkeep of one’s appearance becomes a matter of broader wellbeing, not just aesthetics. Robert Fisher and Yu Ma have found that when children need empathy and aid in bad situations, the same halo-effect stereotype means that children who are perceived as attractive are also <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://doi.org/10.1086/676967 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="seen to be suffering less" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">seen to be suffering less</a>. Reading such studies, a line from Stand up and Cheer floats through my mind. Appearing ahead of FDR’s Fair Labor Standards Act (1938), the film appears to be lobbying for the exemption of actors from child labor laws. In the film, Temple plays the daughter of an actor who includes her in the family act; arguing that her work shouldn’t be taken away he says, “Shirley doesn't really work in the act—she just sort of comes on at the finish and she loves it…She thrives on it.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Temple is a remarkable for persevering through the assumptions that the beautiful are happy and healthy. Temple opens her autobiography with a dedication to her mother, writing movingly of an early memory in which Gertrude guides a buggy with the naked baby Temple inside, nude sunbathing being “Mother’s ritual for infant health.” The star interprets the memory through the lens of her lifetime: “My buggy, me in charge, but not alone.”</p><img alt="baby daughter beautiful" title="baby daughter beautiful" width=2448 height=3059 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-baby-embed2-1496954303.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Katherine Fusco</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although I’d love my daughter to think of me this fondly, I feel Temple is sugarcoating things a bit. The buggy story is, after all, an image of Gertrude steering. And the course of feminine beauty was fraught with peril for Shirley as it is for all girls: during her career, Greene felt free to write about the child’s sexual appeal, Fox hired its young star a bodyguard because of kidnapping fears, and as she approached puberty, her employers made fending off sexual advances part of her regular workday. I can’t help but think that the dangers she underwent are due in part to concretizing her loveliness into a thing-like beauty that her admirers and detractors felt free to possess or discard.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Better, I think, to navigate a safer course, protecting my daughter from these hazards as long as I can. Although I love to dance, and my daughter bops along to music in the kitchen, I am resisting Tumbling for Tots and Mommy-and-Me Ballet, hoping to ward off the cans of glitter and hairspray, the tubes of lip-gloss and eyelash glue while I am still able. As they are for all girls, the perils of feminine beauty will be there waiting for my child, whether I lead her there or not.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/5998ac4c-7ce9-4eeb-a9b0-d6ba42456c5c_1496849908.jpg alt="Headshot of katherine Fusco" title="Headshot of katherine Fusco" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Katherine Fusco is an Assistant Professor of English at the University of Nevada, Reno, where she researches the way different media forms shape identity and encourage us to be either cruel or kind to one another.
