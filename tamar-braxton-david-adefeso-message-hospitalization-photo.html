The video showed Tamar and her boyfriend in Santa Barbara, toasting to their engagement, however it isn’t clear when the video was filmed.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/CDX2-HGBDLS/</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The reality star was with David at the time of her distress, as heard in a&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>911 audio call</a>&nbsp;obtained by&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife</strong>. He could be heard panicking on the call, telling a 911 dispatcher in part, that his girlfriend “has been drinking. She’s on medication for depression. I don’t know how much. She sent a letter earlier. Just ask them to hurry.” He then stuck by her side while she was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>hospitalized</a> in mid July. Tamar added in her caption.&nbsp;“I was in our home lifeless & I’m sure finding me the way that you did couldn’t have been easy. But know that people coming at you saying all crazy stuff, isn’t easy for me,” she wrote.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“that through this entire time, you have held my hand, heard my cries, held me when I have been weak. You have had my ENTIRE back … You were here for me when NOBODY was and still is. YOU and [her son] son,&nbsp;<strong>Logan Herbert</strong> are priority. Thank you for being my Rock and now, my Angel on earth. I love you.. and although I been said yes in this old video… now and then, I couldn’t imagine what life would be like if you weren’t by my side. thank God I’m here and thank God for you.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tamar-braxton-david-adefeso-mega-post.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>It comes just one day after Tamar <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>cut ties from WE tv</a>. “Tamar Braxton has been an important part of our network family for more than a decade,” the network said. “As she focuses on her health and recovery at what is clearly a difficult and personal time, we will work with her representatives to honor her request to end all future work for the network,” the network continued, adding, “We wish her nothing but the best.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH15e49rZq2ZnZa%2Fbq7Rmq%2Btp55isaLCyJ1kmpyVm7K0u4ymnKyrkZyybrTOrKeirJGhtrut06Kmp2Wgnby1u44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
