Glennan passed away on Jan. 10, 2021 after a lengthy struggle with Parkinson's Disease.</p><p>Glennan was the son of Edward Glennan Grady and Corine Coyle Grady, born on Oct. 20, 1935, in New Orleans. He grew up in Laurel and graduated from George S. Gardiner High School in 1952. He attended Mississippi State College, where he was a member of the Kappa Sigma fraternity, graduating with a degree in petroleum geology in 1957. Upon graduation, he went to work for Haliburton in Houma, La. In October 1957, he married Janice Wilcox from Laurel.</p><p>He was an active reservist with the U.S. Army from 1957 through 1963. Glennan returned to Mississippi State University and received a Bachelor of Science degree in forestry in 1961. He was a member of Delta Pi Delta honorary forestry fraternity and was selected the outstanding graduate in the School of Forest Resources. In May 1961, he joined Tennessee River Pulp and Paper Co. in Counce, Tenn., (later becoming Packaging Corporation of America) living first in Savannah, Tenn., and later moving to Corinth in 1962.

In 1992, he was a primary developer of Chips Inc. in Glen and served as the president. The mill retained in operation until 2002.</p><p>One of Glennan's greatest joys was playing golf and the wonderful fellowships with his golf friends.
