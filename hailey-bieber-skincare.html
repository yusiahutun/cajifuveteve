I’ve had a lot of makeup artists use this on me and I love it,” she explained in this <a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#>TikTok</a>. Julia Roberts, Victoria Beckham and Rebel Wilson also praise this moisturizer for its ability to lock in moisture and leave a dewy finish.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/beautystat-universal-c-skin-refiner-skinstore.png><p>BeautyStat Universal C Skin Refiner</p><p><span>What’s the secret to her glow? Perhaps this vitamin C serum. In a </span><a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#><span>YouTube video</span></a><span>, Hailey said, “It has changed my skin. One of my Holy Grail products.” We can totally see why because </span><a rel=noopener href=#><span>vitamin C</span></a><span> is the multitasking, overachieving skincare ingredient almost everyone should have in their skincare routine. It fades dark spots, promotes collagen production, gently exfoliates and prevents free radical damage.
