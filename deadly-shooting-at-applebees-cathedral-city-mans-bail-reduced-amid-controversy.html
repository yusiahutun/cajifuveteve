His bail was lowered by $900,000. The man’s name is Willie R. Bustamante, aged 33. He’s been charged with murder and is accused of using a firearm to cause serious injury.</p><p>During a recent court hearing at the Larson Justice Center, a judge from Riverside County Superior Court decided to decrease Bustamante’s bail from $1 million to $100,000. However, the Riverside County District Attorney’s Office strongly disagreed with this decision.</p><p>On August 6 at 11:31 p.m., officers were called to a disturbance at the Applebee’s located at 32400 Date Palm Drive. The situation involved multiple people. Amid the altercation, someone pulled out a gun and shot Ernesto Lazcano Arroyo, a 31-year-old resident of Cathedral City. Arroyo was found inside the restaurant with gunshot wounds and was taken to a hospital by Cathedral City Fire Department paramedics. Unfortunately, he succumbed to his injuries and passed away.</p><p>Cathedral City Police Department detectives conducted an investigation that involved interviews and leads. They collaborated with the Riverside County Gang Impact Team, which monitored Bustamante’s residence on Dinah Shore Drive (in the 69100 block) and executed a search warrant.</p><p>Another individual was also identified as a possible suspect in the incident. This person was arrested and taken to the John J. Benoit Detention Center in Indio.
