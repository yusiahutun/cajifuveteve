During their 10 days in “The Pods”, the couples decide if they wanted to get engaged—still sight unseen—or end their relationships for a better connection with someone else. After the proposal, the couples meet face-to-face for the first time and go on a honeymoon, where they learn more about each other and meet the other couples. After the trip, the couples, who all live in the same city, return to the real world and move into an apartment together as they meet each other’s families and friends and prepare for their weddings. At the altar on their wedding days, the couples must decide whether to marry or breakup as they answer the age-old question of if love can be truly blind.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>Since <a href=# rel=noopener>Love Is Blind</a> premiered on Netlix in 2020, the show has become one of service’s highest-rated series, with more than 30 million views in its first two months. “Across the world, everybody feels the same way: Everyone wants to be loved for who they are on the inside. It doesn’t matter where you live, what you look like, how old you are, what your background is, which class you know, or social structure you feel like you’re a part of, everyone wants to be loved for who they are,” creator Chris Coelen told Variety in 2020. “In today’s society we’ve got all these ways to find love through dating apps and technology. Those things sort of counterintuitively have made people feel disposable. They’ve made people feel like it’s all surface level. It does the opposite thing it was supposed to do. So we thought, what if we took everybody’s devices away, how could we get them to focus on connecting with other people?”</p><p>Coelen also told <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> about how&nbsp;the connections on <a href=# rel=noopener>Love Is Blind</a> were based on choice, which is why the relationships were that much stronger. “It was incredibly scary because nobody had to do anything, versus a show like we do Married at First Sight, you sign up and you know, you’re getting married to a stranger. Here, nobody had to do anything. It was if you find someone, if you choose. Which is so scary. They don’t have to go through with the wedding ceremony,” he said. “But assuming they found someone, could that love overcome any judgment in the real world? That’s an incredibly fascinating question. And that’s what we set out to try to examine.”</p><p>But back to Alexa and Brennon. So…are <a href=# rel=noopener>Alexa and Brennon still together from Love Is Blind season 3</a>? Read on for what we know about if Alexa and Brennon are still together after Love Is Blind season 3 and where they are now since the “After the Altar” special finished filming?</p><h2>Are Alexa and Brennon still together from Love Is Blind season 3?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Alexa-Brennon-Love-Is-Blind-Season-3.png><p>Are Alexa and Brennon still together after Love Is Blind season 3? The answer is yes. Alexa and Brennon confirmed they were still together in the Love Is Blind season 3 “After the Altar” special in February 2023. In an interview with<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> Us Weekly</a> at the time, Alexa and Brennon confirmed they were trying for children. “[We’re] working and twerking on it,” Alexa said. Alexa also confirmed that Brennon and her father had become closer since Love Is Blind season 3 finished filming.&nbsp;“It’s funny ’cause, well, it’s all in love,” Alexa said. “It’s how my dad treats me. He doesn’t treat Brennon any different than he treats me. … Everyone [was] reading [into it], like, ‘Oh, he doesn’t like Brennan,’ or ‘Is your dad finally accepting of him?’ And it’s like, my dad was accepting from the first moment that they met. They did a shot together and it was [like], ‘Hi, welcome to the family, son.’ That’s just how my dad’s personality is.”</p><p>Brennon also confirmed that he and Alexa’s father had “a great relationship” despite the unusual way he and Alexa met. “I’ve gotta give your dad a lot more props,” he said. “Because if our kids, like, bring somebody home in two weeks … I’m giving the third-degree. Like, we’re going out back. You know what I’m saying?” He teased: “If I was in his position, I would’ve gone way harder than what he went on me. … I try to be open-minded, but it’s hard to put yourself in those shoes.”</p><p>Alexa and Brennon were one of two couples who said “I do” at the altar of their wedding day in episode 11 of Love Is Blind season 3. The other couple was Colleen Reed and Matt Bolton. Alexa and Brennon married on June 30, 2021, according to the marriage license filed in the County of Dallas, Texas. The license listed Alexa Danielle Alfia as applicant one, and Brennon Taylor Lemieux as applicant two. The license was recorded on July 16, 2021, and seemed to confirm Alexa and Brennon married in the Love Is Blind season 3 finale three days before Colleen and Matt, who married on July 2, 2021. “Never in a million years did I think that I would find the love of my life on the other side of a pod wall. You make me laugh, you make me think and more than anything else, you make me happy. I can’t wait to build the rest of our futures together. I promise to give you the jingle-jangle for the rest of forever,” Alexa told Brennon at the altar of their wedding.</p><p>Alexa and Brennon confirmed they were still together and married in the Love Is Blind season 3 reunion. They also revealed they had moved into a two-bedroom apartment together. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Elite Daily</a> after the Love Is Blind season 3 reunion, Alexa revealed how she knew she wanted to say “I do” to Brennon. There was never an exact moment,” she said. “It was just never a no. Once I was just like, ‘He’s my person on the other side,’ you just keep going with that…All the way up to wedding day, we were questioning it … ‘Should we be fighting more?’ And it just never happened.” Brennon, for his part, told the site that it was Alexa’s values and personality that made him realize he wanted her to be his wife.&nbsp;“She has this way of talking, communicating, and letting you see how she’s so much fun on the outside, but really on the inside, she’s so sweet and so she’s into family and all the values in life that I hold dear,” he said. “It really just stuck out. I went from, ‘Man, I really like this person’ to ‘I love this person,’ to ‘I’m in love with this person. I’m going to marry them. Whether it happens here or in person, whether we’re on the show, off the show, we’re getting married, it’s done.’”</p><p>Before the Love Is Blind season 3 finale aired, there was speculation over Alexa and Brennon’s relationship status based on their social media. Though Alexa and Brennon didn’t follow each other on Instagram, Brennon, who only followed around 150 people on Instagram, Brennon did follow a few of Alexa’s close friends on Instagram, including a friend named <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">America</a>, a friend named <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Orel Pilo</a>, a friend named <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Cara Abramov</a> and a friend named <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Darshir Brewington</a>.</p><p>Alexa and Brennon were also friends on Venmo, though they hadn’t sent any payments to each other. Alexa was also Venmo friends with Raven Ross, another contestant from Love Is Blind season 3, while Brennon was friends with SK Alagbada, another contestant from Love Is Blind season 3, who was in a couple with Raven. “Foodddddd,” Raven wrote in a Venmo transaction to Alexa in October 2022. Raven and Colleen Reed, another contestant from Love Is Blind season 3, also Venmoed Alexa’s family member about what seemed to be a second Bachelorette party for Alexa in March 2022. “Bach pt 2,” Raven wrote in one transaction. She also wrote in another transaction, “Alexa cabana boys.”</p><p>In an interview with<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> Women’s Health</a> after Love Is Blind season 3, Alexa reacted to a scene where her father jokingly brought out a set of knives after Brennon confirmed he would convert to Judaism for Alexa. “My mom made a decision early on in my life,” she said. “I had no idea that that had happened. And [Brennon] was like, ‘You know, your dad threatened me with circumcision.’ My dad is very funny. I think it was also like a test to see how Brennan would react to something just funny like that.”</p><h2><span>Who is Alexa from </span>Love Is Blind<span> season 3?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Alexa_Alfia_Love-Is-Blind-Season-3.jpg><p>Who is Alexa from Love Is Blind season 3?

Love Is Blind season 1 was filmed in Atlanta, Georgia, while season 2 was filmed in Chicago, Illinois. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a> in 2020, Love Is Blind creator Chris Coelen explained that each season casts contestants from the same city so long distance isn’t a factor in their relationships. “It was a really interesting and diverse cast in terms of the fact that they were all from many different places originally,” he said. “But they were all living around the Atlanta area [at the time of casting]. The reason that we did that was because we wanted to give these people a real shot at making their relationships work for the long term.”</p><p>He continued, “Whether you think [love] is going to happen or not, we wanted people that would be ready to be married. If you’re really in it—genuinely in it, which was the No. 1 casting criteria—it felt to us that it was too much of a bridge for someone living in Miami and someone living in Seattle to build. We thought let’s at least start with them in the same geographical area.”</p><p>Coelen also explained to <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> in 2020 about why he wanted each Love Is Blind season to cast contestants from the same city. “We wanted people to all be living, currently in the same place. It’s too difficult if you’re from Tampa and they’re from Portland, that just throws another wrench in. We wanted to give them a real shot at making their love and their marriage working,” he said. Coelen also told Variety at the time about the locations he was looking at for future Love Is Blind seasons. “Look, the idea is that ultimately we’re going to do this in other countries—it’s very global. There’s lots of places that that we could take it. Chicago is a great place to look at, so is New York, Boston, Houston. There’s so many different places that we could go. And like I said, outside of the country as well,” he said.</p><p>Coelen also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Oprah</a> magazine in 2020 that The Pods lasted around 10 days, which started with a series of speed dates between contestants that lasted between eight to 12 minutes. We did a ranking system, from who you though was most compatible to least compatible after the first date. Every day, the list got shorter and shorter,” Love Is Blind season 1 contestant Mark Cuevas told Oprah magazine at the time. Coelen also told Oprah magazine made the cast smaller a few days into the The Pods stage to focus on the contestants forming “real connections.” “We ended up focusing on people who were really forming real connections,” he said.</p><p>Though the dates started short, Coelen told Variety that the producers allowed contestants to have longer dates once they saw how strong their connections were. “In the beginning nobody knew who anybody was. So we structured it so that they would have an opportunity to talk to everyone. They were never given any instruction on what to say or what not to say or what they could ask about or what they couldn’t ask about. And you see on the show, some people decided to [ask] ‘How tall are you, what do you look like?'” he said. “Other people were like, ‘Why would I ever do that? That’s not the point of this.’ We really wanted it to be their own story, their own journey. We would set it up so they had the opportunity to talk to everybody. Then from that point [it was monitored]. Let’s say somebody really wanted to talk to you and you’re like, ‘Yeah, I have no interest in that person.'”</p><p>He continued, “You’re not going to talk to them. It doesn’t matter. We’re not going to arrange people to speak to one another where somebody’s like, ‘yeah, I don’t want to talk to that person.’ We just wouldn’t do that. Multiple points throughout the day we had to break and they had to eat, go to the bathroom, go do interviews, but generally we wanted to give them as much time in the pods as possible with the people that they genuinely wanted to talk to. These dates are obviously cut down but they were hours and hours and hours long.”</p><h2>Who are the Love Is Blind season 3 hosts?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nick-Vanessa-Lachey-Love-Is-Blind.png><p>The Love Is Blind season 3 hosts are Nick Lachey and Vanessa Lachey, who have hosted the series since it premiered in February 2020. The couple also hosted season 1 of Netflix’s The Ultimatum. Nick was the lead singer of the boy band 98 Degrees from 1996 to 2012. The group reunited in 2012 and are still together. Nick has also released four solo alums: SoulO, What’s Left of Me, A Father’s Lullaby and Soundtrack of My Life. He was married to Jessica Simpson from 2002 to 2006, and the two also starred in their own reality show, Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica on MTV, from 2003 to 2005. Nick is also the winner of season 5 of The Masked Singer&nbsp;during which he performed as the character “Piglet.” Vanessa was the 1998 Miss Teen USA and was a correspondent for Entertainment Tonight and Total Request Live on MTV. She’s the current lead in CBS’ NCIS spinoff, NCIS: Hawai’i, which premiered in 2021.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Distractify</a> in March 2022, Nick explained that he and Vanessa wanted to host Love Is Blind because of how their own relationship was long distance when they first started dating. “When Netflix approached us with Love is Blind all those years ago, we jumped at the opportunity because the show really spoke to us personally,” Nick said. “When we first started dating, Vanessa was in New York and I was in Los Angeles. We didn’t get to see each other a lot so we had a lot of long phone conversations, learning everything we possibly could about each other.” He continued, “[Those conversations were] really important for building our relationship and knowing we wanted the same things before there were external pressures on the relationship.” Nick also told Distractify that he and Vanessa want contestants to “fall in love for the right reasons and then introduce everything else.”</p><p>Nick also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in 2022 about how he thinks Love Is Blind would’ve worked for him and Vanessa if they had met in The Pods.&nbsp;“We’ve thought about that, often. And I really, I’m not just saying this for the benefit of this show, I think we would’ve,” he said. “We have the same birthday, we have the same passions, we have the same interests, we have the same drive. Things that motivated us.” Vanessa asked “You would’ve found me through a wall?” to which Nick responded, “I would find you anywhere.” He continued, “I really do think we would’ve found each other. I think we would’ve gravitated to each other. That’s what we did in life. Obviously, we knew each other.” Vanessa added, “We did. We had to find our journey to get to each other.”</p><p>Nick also claimed to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us <span>Weekly</span></a><span>&nbsp;in 2022 that he would’ve joined Love Is Blind if he was single. “I would. I mean, it’s fascinating,” he said. “Especially having seen the success of season 1 and seeing two loving couples still married to this day? If I watched that and I was looking for love, why wouldn’t you wanna be a part of that? You know, it’s proven to work!” He added, </span>“This dating world is not one I ever was part of — this very superficial ‘swipe left.’ There’s so much judgment and you can Google everybody. I’m not from that era.”</p><p>Love Is Blind season 3 is available to stream on Netflix.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Leap-of-Faith-Cameron-Hamilton-Lauren-Speed.jpeg><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$15.89</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>$28.00</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>43% Off</span></p><p><span class=s1>For more about Love Is Blind, read Cameron Hamilton and Lauren Speed’s 2021 book,<a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2><i> Leap of Faith: Finding Love the Modern Way</i></span></a></span><span class=s3><i>. </i></span><span class=s1>In the book, Cameron and Lauren, who were one of two couples to marry from <i>Love Is Blind</i> season 1, share their “engaging and accessible love advice for the modern world” and reveal exclusive behind-the-scenes details from the Netflix series and what went down in The Pods that viewers didn’t see.
