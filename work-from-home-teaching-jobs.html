You could turn your know-how into a lucrative career without even leaving your home. That’s because students around the world are looking for virtual teachers in a wide range of subjects to instruct them remotely. While some virtual teachers have certificates in education and experience in the classroom, fact is, formal training or teaching experience isn’t required for many work from home teaching jobs.</p><p>Wondering if you’d be happy as a virtual teacher? Ask yourself if you have these traits: “Successful virtual teachers are engaging, enthusiastic, patient and tech-savvy,” says <a href=# rel=noopener>Lily Jones </a>teacher career coach and CEO of<a href=# rel=noopener> Educator Forever</a>. These qualities ensure you can effectively share information with students and keep them motivated.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>“Don’t be afraid to get started,” encourages business advisor <a href=# rel=noopener>Gwen Bortner</a>, founder and CEO of <a href=# rel=noopener>Everyday Effectiveness</a>. “You don’t have to know everything on the topic you’re teaching. You just need to know more than the people who sign up to learn from you,” says Bortner who is also the virtual teacher of <a href=# rel=noopener>Craftsy’s</a> popular video class “<a href=# rel=noopener>How to Teach It”</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How much can I make as a work from home teacher?</h2><p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, you can earn <a href=# rel=noopener>$21.55 per hour and $44,820 annually</a> on average by tutoring online.</p><p>However, that figure can be different based on how you decide to virtually teach. For example, in many cases when you give private lessons, you get to decide how much to charge. To pick the rate that works best, check out the fees other virtual teachers are charging. Then adjust your rate by taking into account your level of expertise and amount of experience you have.</p><p>When using pre-recorded videos to teach, you may get paid from a royalty based on the number of views your videos receive.</p><p>And if you’re hired by a school or company to be their virtual teacher, you may get paid by the lesson or by the hour, depending on the position.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How do I get started with my work from home teaching job?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/GettyImages-1247894283.jpg><p>The tools you’ll need to be a work from home teacher are a computer with a webcam and microphone along with a reliable Internet connection.</p><p>If your Wi-Fi Internet connection is weak (for instance, your video lags or freezes), buy a CAT-6 Ethernet cable (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from BestBuy, $10</a>) and a USB-C to Ethernet adapter (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from BestBuy, $15</a>). Attach the cable directly from your computer to your modem and you’ll get a stable, fast connection.</p><p>One big benefit of being a virtual teacher is that you can customize the job to fit your needs. For example, you can record and upload videos that students can watch at any time. Or you can teach students in real time through live video. Additionally, you can choose who your students will be (kids or adults), the subject you’ll teach and whether you want the flexibility of making your own hours or the predictability of being employed by a school or company.</p><p>On top of that, there are a wide variety of teaching platforms and tools that you can use to create your virtual classroom. Read on for all of these options that can help you launch your virtual teaching jobs and the easy steps to get started.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1. Upload videos on to teaching platforms</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/GettyImages-1293351419.jpg><p>The easiest way to start teaching virtually is by recording videos of your virtual classes, then uploading them to teaching platforms for free. The most popular teaching platforms include:</p><ul><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Skillshare</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Take Lessons</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Udemy</a></li></ul><p>Once you upload your videos, these websites do all the work for you from there: They post your videos online. They share them with students looking to learn the skill you’re teaching. And they pay you royalties based on the number of views your videos receive.</p><p>The students who visit these teaching platforms are interested in learning a wide range of topics. So, in most cases, you’ll be able to teach any subject you want, such as baking, drawing, knitting, piano or website design.</p><p><strong>To get started:</strong> Sign up for a free account on a teaching platform, then follow the guidelines for recording and submitting your virtual class.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Success story: “I bring in up to $12,000 a month teaching bread baking!”</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/terasa.jpg><p>“Over ten years ago, I left a 30-year marriage, had two of my 10 children at home (one of whom was disabled) and was caring for my mother. I didn’t go to college, I had no job experience and I needed to find a way to make money,” says<a href=# rel=noopener> Teresa Greenway</a>, 64.</p><p>I had a website where I taught people how to bake sourdough bread and a bit of a following on a Yahoo group, but I never made any money from it. Then I discovered<a href=# rel=noopener> Udemy</a>, a platform that offers online courses. I took a few courses on making videos and making money on YouTube and then realized I could use the platform to sell my bread-baking courses. I launched my first course in 2015 and made $1,000 in the first month!”</p><p>“Udemy offers free classes on how to build your courses. I developed a course outline, a curriculum, quizzes, worksheets, PDF downloads and recipes. I used an older video camera that I had on hand, but you can use a smartphone or an iPad. With each new course I created, I bought more tools like video-editing software and a better microphone. I now have 13 different courses on sourdough bread baking. To market them, I use my website (<a href=# rel=noopener>NorthwestSourdough.com</a>), YouTube and Facebook, where I post coupons for the courses.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Baking sourdough is my passion, and I love teaching people about it. My courses cost between $29 and $99, and I’ve made up to $12,000 a month — money that helped me purchase and pay off my first home!”&nbsp;— as told to <a href=# rel=noopener>Julie Revelant</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Work from home teaching jobs: Use your own website</h2><p>If you already have your own website, you can pay for a virtual teaching jobs software subscription that allows you to share live and pre-recorded virtual classes right on your site. For example, DIY expert Beth Allen of <a href=# rel=noopener>DIYHipChicks.com</a> teaches virtual classes on home repairs such as how to caulk and fix clogs (see her success story below!).</p><p>And Winifred Kristé of<a href=# rel=noopener> WinifredKristeCake.com </a>teaches virtual classes on the art of creating wafer paper flowers for cake decoration.</p><p>This way, you can market your virtual classes directly to existing fans who already visit your website. Plus, you can avoid competing with virtual teachers on a platform that hosts other instructors. Other benefits: Virtual teaching software makes it easier to manage your classes by handling sales and student payments, providing marketing tools and analyzing student usage so you can pinpoint your class’s strengths and build on them.</p><p>Some popular virtual teaching software subscriptions include:</p><ul><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Kajabi</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>LearnDash</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>LearnWorlds</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Teachable</a></li></ul><p>Prices range from $29 to $119 per month for basic service plans. You can select higher-priced plans that give you more options.</p><p><strong>To get started: </strong>Check out the features of virtual teaching software subscriptions to find the right one for you. Then follow the instructions for adding the video software to your website. If you don’t have your own website yet, some of these companies will help you build one (such as Kajabi).</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Success story: “I make $100K a year teaching home repair classes!”</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/beth-allen-1.jpg><p>“When I was home with my first child, I started doing home renovation projects — I always loved to fix things,” says <a href=# rel=noopener>Beth Allen</a>, 51. “I took a certificate of design program and worked with large-budget clients. Although I enjoyed the work, I really wanted to help women on a budget do their own home renovation projects so they could feel safe and maintain their property’s value. I reached out to my local community center and proposed a five-week class, and they agreed!</p><p>“I now teach classes at community colleges and adult evening schools, plus offer online courses at<a href=# rel=noopener> DiyHipChicks</a>. The online courses include an intensive class that has 8 to 10 lessons about electric, plumbing, carpentry, appliance care, tool basics and drywall and a short class that covers seven basic home repairs. The courses also include private coaching and a private Facebook group. I’m helping women fix their home and flip their mindset — I want them to think big and give them confidence. I love when women get excited realizing they can do their own home repairs.”</p><p>“I promote my classes on social media, through my newsletter and via realtors and women’s empowerment groups. I make $100,000 a year, which helps pay for my kids’ college tuitions. I’m also saving to buy a school bus to bring DIY, life skills, financial literacy and parenting classes to underserved women in the community.” — as told to <a href=# rel=noopener>Julie Revelant</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Work from home teaching jobs: Teach kids remotely</h2><p>Enjoy teaching children math, reading and other academic subjects?

And you can pick the type of teaching role that suits you best.</p><p>If you prefer the flexibility of making your own hours, you can have find virtual teacher jobs at an online tutoring company. Some require at least a bachelor’s degree and teaching certificate, like these:</p><ul><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Qkids</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>VIP Teacher</a></li></ul><p>Other online tutoring companies do not require formal teaching credentials as long as you can show you’re proficient in the subjects you want to teach, such as these:</p><ul><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Outschool</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Varsity Tutors</a></li></ul><p>If you prefer the steadiness of regular hours, check out job posts for virtual teaching positions at schools, which you can find at:</p><ul><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Indeed</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>TeachAway</a></li></ul><p><strong>To get started:</strong> Find the teaching position that suits your needs most, then submit your application detailing your background and experience.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Success story: “I make up to $2,000 a month teaching online!”</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/teacher.jpg><p>“After retiring from teaching in 2020, I was looking for ways to make money from home, and I came across <a href=# rel=noopener>Outschool</a>, an online learning platform,” says <a href=# rel=noopener>Maria Thorne</a>, 54. “I loved the idea of working with kids remotely and making my own schedule. To apply, I answered some questions and created an introduction video and mini ­lesson. Since I wanted to teach craft classes, I recorded a tutorial on how to make wallets out of duct tape, and Outschool welcomed me aboard within a few hours!”</p><p>“On average, I spend 5 to 10 hours a week teaching arts and crafts, STEM, geography, social skills and language arts classes from my home craft room. I offer holiday-themed art classes, so months with holidays are my busiest times. These classes coincide with when children are out of school, so there’s always a demand!”</p><p>“I earn up to $2,000 per month with Outschool. I have full control over the price of each class and the number of participants, and get paid via PayPal. Outschool instructors keep 70% of the class fees. This income has allowed me to pay off debt and help my kids with college and furniture shopping.”</p><p>“I love the children and families that I have had the privilege of meeting, and seeing positive reviews on my profile makes my day. I get to do all of the things that make teaching fun and none of the things that once burned me out.” — as told to <a href=#>Hannah Chenoweth</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Work from home teaching jobs: Live 1-on-1 virtual tutoring</h2><p>Lots of adults are looking for live 1-on-1 tutoring in all sorts of subjects, such as crocheting, photography and yoga. You can reach these students to teach them your expertise on free platforms that host live virtual lessons, such as:</p><ul><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Preply</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Take Lessons</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Wyzant</a></li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Success story: “I earn $8,000 a month giving virtual violin lessons!”</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/susanna.jpg><p>“When I moved to Pittsburgh seven years ago, finding a new job was tough, so I began to research creative ways to put my skills (I worked for 15 years as an orchestra teacher in public schools) to use and make money,” says <a href=# rel=noopener>Susanna Sonnenberg</a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>53. “Then I found <a href=# rel=noopener>TakeLessons.com</a>, a free, easy-to-use platform that connects students with teachers in all kinds of subject areas, including music. I was thrilled! I set up an online profile to teach violin, viola and cello.”</p><p>“I quickly passed the screening process and started teaching. How it works: When TakeLessons delivers a student, a fee is deducted from what I charge students. The fee decreases over time, so the more I teach, the more I earn.&nbsp;</p><p>“At first, this was a <a href=#>side hustle</a> to bring in extra cash. But within six months, I had 50 students and began teaching full-time. My husband lost his job in 2016, so I became the primary breadwinner. Today, I earn an average of $8,000 a month teaching private lessons in person and online. I have about 60 students, from young kids to grown-ups, and typically teach 45 hours each week.”</p><p>“TakeLessons does the marketing for me, so I can focus on what I do best: teaching. I love that I don’t have to worry about finding my next student.&nbsp;</p><p>“The best part: I can do what I love and support my family, without having to rely on an employer. TakeLessons allows me to teach where I want to teach, who I want to teach, when I want to teach and how I want to teach!” — as told to <a href=#>Hannah Chenoweth</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. Work from home teaching jobs: Teach on YouTube</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/GettyImages-1227002397.jpg><p>Chances are, you’ve watched quite a few videos on YouTube. Well, you can upload your own videos of your virtual lessons to YouTube for students to view. While you don’t get paid through royalties earned from views or from per-lesson fees, there is the potential to earn ad revenue through<a href=# rel=noopener> YouTube’s Partner Program.</a> And those earnings can add up quick! According to<a href=# rel=noopener> Business Insider</a> YouTube content providers earn between <a href=# rel=noopener>$1.61 and $29.30 per 1,000 views</a>, which can lead to raking in hundreds, even thousands, every month.</p><p>To become eligible for ad-sharing revenue, you’ll need to get 1,000 subscribers along with 4,000 hours of viewed video within the previous 12 months. You can then apply to become a YouTube Partner in your <a href=# rel=noopener>YouTube Studio dashboard</a> (in the left menu, click Earn, then Apply).</p><p>The more subscribers you get, the higher your earnings tend to go. And since YouTube is the second most-visited website on the Internet behind Google, there’s plenty of opportunity to accumulate subscribers.</p><p>Another way to earn with virtual classes on YouTube is by selling goods related to your lesson subject. For example, if you teach jewelry-making, you can promote your<a href=# rel=noopener> Etsy</a> store. And if you teach yard sale flipping, you can promote your <a href=# rel=noopener>eBay</a> store.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Success story: “I bring in a full-time income teaching others how to knit!”</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/knitting.jpg><p>“My grandmother was an experienced and talented knitter, and when she passed away, I inherited her knitting books,” says <a href=#>Kristen McDonnell</a>, 53. “My sister was pregnant at the time, so I thought it would be fun to knit blankets and clothes for the new baby, and I turned to YouTube to learn how.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Ten years later, my sister was working for a company that helps YouTubers grow their audiences in exchange for a cut of their ad revenue. They were looking for a channel about knitting, and she asked me if I knew of a good one. There were some, but they weren’t very engaging, so I offered to create one myself. My sister asked me to pitch a few videos and said it was okay if they weren’t professional looking. I created a cardboard contraption to get a good view of my hands, used my iPad to film and named my channel ‘<a href=# rel=noopener>Studio Knit</a>.’ After two videos, the agency signed me, and although they didn’t pay me, I received free education, music and collaborations with their other clients to help me grow my channel.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Eventually, I decided to go out on my own. I started publishing one teaching video per week on YouTube on topics like techniques, knitting projects, product reviews and Q&As, making sure to go slowly so the videos would be easy to understand. I monetize the videos with ads, which pay by minutes watched. I also have brand partnerships with companies that pay me to demonstrate and recommend their products. I market the videos through my blog, social media, especially Pinterest, and my email newsletter.”&nbsp;</p><p>“I love creating videos, and when people email me their feedback and success stories, it warms my heart! I now make a full-time income and I’m only working part-time hours! The money I make pays the bills and for guilty pleasures like manicures and ­vacations to Hawaii!”&nbsp; — as told to <a href=# rel=noopener>Julie Revelant</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>To get started</h3><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Create a YouTube account,</a> then click “Create a New Channel” give it a name, then tap “Create”. From there, you can use the <a href=# rel=noopener>YouTube Studio</a> to upload, edit and publish your videos.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to be successful as a work-from-home teacher</h2><p>“Focus on engagement and building relationships,” recommends Jones. “When students are having fun and feel comfortable with you, they will be ready to learn. Though virtual teaching sessions may be short, always spend time intentionally checking in with your students.”</p><p>It’s also important to manage your time and energy when doing work from home teaching jobs. “Consider how many sessions you can realistically do every day,” Jones advises. “Teaching can be exhausting, particularly with back-to-back sessions. Ideally, build in breaks between sessions so you can have a moment to rest and recharge.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to help students learn best when teaching from home</h2><p>“Reduce the amount of content that you are trying to share,” urges Bortner. “Our natural tendency is to want to provide as much knowledge as possible to ensure our students feel like their investment was valuable,” she notes about work from home teaching jobs. “But too much knowledge overwhelms and paralyzes the student. And they can’t get the value of your program if they don’t finish it. If you are new to teaching, usually your initial plan could be divided into 2 or 3 separate classes.”</p><p>Also smart: When teaching a skills-based live class (such as knitting or playing the guitar), keep in mind how long it typically takes for students to learn and complete tasks (such as copying a stitch or chord you demonstrate) in real time. “A good rule of thumb for determining how long it will take a student to complete a specific task or portion of a project is 3:1. For every 1 minute/hour it takes you to do the activity, it will take 3 minutes/hours for the student to complete the same activity in a class setting,” Bortner points out. “This ratio includes your time to teach as well as their time to actually do what you’ve taught,” she adds. “You don’t want to feel like you’re rushing or having to cut content on the fly.”</p><p><strong>For more ways to earn money working from home, click through the links below!</strong></p><p><a href=#>5 Genius Ways You Can Work for Walmart — From Home!</a></p><p><a href=#>7 Ways to Make $1000s a Month From Home — No Experience Needed!</a></p><p><a href=#>If You Can Type, You Can Earn a Full-Time Salary Doing Work-From-Home Data Entry</a></p><p><a href=#>Make $1,000s a Month With These Work-From-Home Jobs — No Phone Needed!</a></p><p><a href=#>6 Ways to Make Money with Amazon Work-From-Home Jobs</a></p><p><a href=#>5 Weekend Work From Home Jobs — No Experience Needed!</a></p><p><a href=#>9 Easy Ways You Can Work From Home For CVS Health — No Degree Needed</a></p><p><a href=#>3 Easy Steps to Make Upwards of $4,000 a Month By Selling Baked Goods From Home</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJopKimla58uLvRpGSfqp%2Bieqm7zJ5krZ2RmLWqusZmoaiaow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
