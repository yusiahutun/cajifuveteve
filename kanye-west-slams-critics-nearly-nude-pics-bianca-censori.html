In a new video posted to his <a href=#><strong>Instagram</strong></a>, West answered those critics with several very choice words.</p><p>The rapper has come under scrutiny in the press, on social media, and even with local law enforcement in some cases, as Censori appears in incredibly risqué ensembles that at times barely resemble clothing -- but always manage to show a whole lot of skin.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:300d8590-8193-4db6-95e4-073de24610c6 data-container-ref=toofab:article:97450be0-f231-4257-bda8-bf094780cdd0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/89/5by4/2024/02/07/89dec1cc56ff46389b67d99203ff65e0_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">YouTube</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">North West Raps in Surprise Appearance in Kanye West's 'Talking' Music Video</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The latest reactions came after he shared the exact same video of Censori to his Instagram three times in a row on Monday. In it, she is wearing basically one piece of fabric wrapped back to front and completely exposed on the sides. Everyone around her is far more clothed.</p><p>In his video, West said that he posted the video three times "on purpose," though declined to explain what that purpose might be. Walking alongside him, Censori immediately started laughing at that claim, too, which caused him to laugh.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>He also called out people harping about this exposure of his wife when he'd just dropped his collaborative album Vultures with Ty Dolla $ign.</p><p>"The people still in my comments talking about, 'Why you posting your wife?' Cause she makes me happy," West said in the video. "That's why y'all happy with the music, 'cause I'm happy. You understand?"</p><p>"So don't ever say nothing negative," West continued. "If you don't like my page and don't like what I'm posting, go f--k yourself. Seriously, leave me -- leave the king -- the f--k alone."</p><p>He continued by saying he doesn't care what people think and he'll post his wife as much as he wants, countering with, "Go post your wife on your f--king Instagram."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:dc9a1e62-6a63-47ab-9faa-0212a1ea0ac0 data-container-ref=toofab:article:97450be0-f231-4257-bda8-bf094780cdd0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/39/5by4/2023/12/16/39ffa8b6d027452c99ca483e327d79d1_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kanye West Criticized For Selling $200 Sock-Style Yeezy Shoes in First Post-Adidas Release</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>West has comments turned off on that post, but there's still plenty of commentary on those three "on purpose" posts of Censori's latest outfit. Some are calling out West for criticizing ex-wife Kim Kardashian for showing too much of her body, while others recalled his more Christian conservative era. Most, though, just couldn't figure out what he was doing ... or why.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>"I remember how you were upset about Kim back then and didn't want North to be marketed or dressed too revealingly," commented one user on his second share of the video. "Now look at how you present your wife to the world. You want people to take you, your words and your mission seriously. How is that supposed to work if you contradict yourself in your actions?"</p><p>"I've seen Bianca more than my own girl," joked one user, while another accused West of using Censori as "just a prop at this point." Another follower commented, "It was cringe the first time, dude. Now it's just getting sad."</p><p>"It's hard to defend bro," wrote another commenter, while one fan noted, "women don't dress like this." Still another user wrote, "Anyone else confused / concerned / sad / confused again - all at once?"</p><p>"Bro went from GOD fearing to not caring," wrote another user.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:5cc379ff-1cc3-46d5-9277-c85881a51e4d data-container-ref=toofab:article:97450be0-f231-4257-bda8-bf094780cdd0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/00/5by4/2023/09/26/0007dfbc9f7e485180575d456456dc0c_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Julia Fox Says 'There Wasn't Any' Sex During Kanye West Relationship</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>This isn't the first time West has lashed out over questions about Censori. In January he snatched the phone out of the hand of a <a href=#><strong>TMZ</strong></a> camera person when she asked him if he was "controlling" Censori or had banned her from social media, asking if she had "free will."</p><p>West proceeded to berate the camera person for more than three minutes, per the outlet, for asking "a grown-ass superhero" such a question.</p><p>There have been a lot of questions seeking clarity about West's relationship with Censori, though, who does not talk to the media or appear to maintain a social media presence of her own anymore. And then there's all those controversial, barely-there outfits she wears.</p><p>Most recently, she was spotted heading to the studio with West -- who was covered in black head-to-toe -- wearing nothing but a clear poncho (and possibly a tiny nude-colored thong). Still, she was dangerously close to violating public nudity laws.</p><p>West clearly has no intentions of stopping when it comes to pushing the boundaries with Censori's fashion, nor does he plan to stop sharing pictures and videos with his 19.4 million Instagram followers.</p><p>Maybe, just once is enough, though.</p><a id=gallery-link-8e52d0aa-a01b-4d46-a378-8e165324fb4a class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:8e52d0aa-a01b-4d46-a378-8e165324fb4a data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:97450be0-f231-4257-bda8-bf094780cdd0 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/57/4by3/2024/02/13/573fae13a27d44a796a61b6f2ad60a5b_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2tmamtfoK6vxcRmrp6rpGLAra3MrGScqpmptqS%2FjKecmqqcrnqvwcOeZKmhk6h6o7XAp5qaZZOau7S70aJm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
