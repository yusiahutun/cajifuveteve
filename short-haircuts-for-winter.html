It’s still a great choice today for several reasons: it works for all hair types, whether fine or wavy, it’s easy to wash and style quickly, and it showcases your lovely facial features. The only downside is that you’ll have to go in for regular trims to keep it at this length (every four to six weeks is best). That said, you’ll love being able to hop out of the shower, smooth some hair oil such as <strong>Hask Monoi Coconut Shine Oil</strong> ($6, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Ulta.com</a>) through your short strands, and run out the door.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2015/11/baby-bangs.jpg><p><strong>Baby bangs.</strong><br>Despite the name, baby bangs are anything but childish. It takes a special woman to rock a set of ultra-short bangs, but it looks amazing when done right because it really makes your eyes stand out. The downsides for this style? It can take some upkeep to trim your bangs regularly and keep them even and flat. We recommend investing in some dry shampoo to keep them from getting <i>too</i> flat (read: greasy); we like <strong>Living Proof Perfect Hair Day Dry Shampoo</strong> ($22,<a href=# rel=nofollow> ulta.com</a>). You’ll also want to take care to make sure your brows are always wonderfully groomed, since they’ll definitely have center stage. And&nbsp;if you decide baby bangs aren’t for you, it’s not hard to grow them out an inch or two to a normal length—so give it a try!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2015/11/curly-pixie.jpg><p><strong>A curly pixie.</strong><br>If anyone’s ever told you that you can’t have a pixie cut because your hair is too curly, don’t pay any attention. After all, curly pixies are adorable and completely doable. It might be a good idea to keep things shorter on the sides and back, and have the front and top sections of your hair longer—not only is it super-beautiful, it also means you can go a little longer between cuts. After washing your hair, scrunch mousse through your curls before letting your curls do their thing; a good choice is <strong>Kenra Professional Kurl Glaze Mousse 13</strong> ($17, <a href=# rel=nofollow>ulta.com</a>).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2015/11/ruby-rose-bowl-cut-2015.jpg><p><strong>A bowl cut.</strong><br>You read that right: thanks to the likes of <strong><a href=#>Ruby Rose</a>,</strong> the bowl cut is officially back. Luckily it’s come a long way since you had the dreaded haircut in middle school—and can actually be very chic. Shoot for a slightly messier, uneven version for a tousled, rock star vibe. This style works best for girls with naturally straight hair, otherwise you’ll be forced to straighten your waves or curls every morning.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2015/11/best-pageboy-haircut.jpg><p><strong>A page boy.<br></strong>This unusual style is a great cross between feminine and tomboy, and it’s another great one for those with straight, somewhat fine hair. Try a cut that’s a little longer than a bowl cut but shorter than a bob—just beyond your ears—and add blunt bangs just above your brows if you’re feeling particularly adventurous. Not only will it frame your face and neck in a flattering way, but you’ll have the chicest hairstyle in the room.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2015/11/best-bob.jpg><p><strong>A modern&nbsp;bob.</strong><br>This style is so versatile and easy to style, plus it’s great for women who are too nervous to try a short pixie cut. Ask your stylist to cut your hair just below your jaw with no layers. To style it, try a side part right above one eyebrow and then tuck your strands behind your ear on one side, letting the other side fall forward and frame your face. You can also part it down the center and add some very loose waves near your face for a perfectly undone look. Simple, stylish, and very pretty.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2015/11/textured-lob.jpg><p><strong><a href=#>A textured&nbsp;lob</a>.</strong><br>This might be the most popular haircut of the past few years, with countless celebrities sporting the <a href=#>perfectly tousled lob</a> with subtle ombre ends. The ombre ends are up to you, but the rest of the cut is a no-brainer—plus it’s doable no matter what your hair type. If your hair is naturally wavy then you’re pretty much all set, but if you have straight, fine hair you’ll need to spend a few minutes styling it in the morning. We suggest using a texturizing or sea salt spray to add gentle waves; sleeping overnight in braids helps as well. After taking out your braids in the morning, spray some <strong>Not Your Mother’s Beach Babe Texturizing Sea Salt Spray</strong> ($6, <a href=# rel=nofollow>ulta.com</a>) for extra hold and texture. Because really, is it ever too cold for loosely disheveled waves?</p><p><strong>More from Daily Makeover: <a href=#>The 50 Best Bangs for Fall</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLWitdFmpZqhnKh8doKTam5pZ6OdvLPAjKGYoqqTqsG0ecWoqWavmaPBpr6O</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
