For his next single, "Rodeo Man,"<a href=#> Garth Brooks</a> will join forces with <a href=#>Brooks & Dunn</a> singer <a href=#>Ronnie Dunn</a>.</p><p>The song will be available on Monday (Nov. 6), and not all that many details about the song itself are available quite yet. What is clear, however, is that it'll be a fast-paced ride: Clocking in at just under three minutes, a press release describes "Rodeo Man" as a wild "day in the life" of the people who call the rodeo home. The song will impact county radio on Monday, too.</p><p>It makes sense that Dunn would be Brooks' duet partner of choice for "Rodeo Man": Not only is he a superstar with serious '90s country cred and the word "COWBOY" tattooed in big block letters up his arm, but Dunn also co-wrote this track with Phil O'Donnell.</p><figure class="img-tag alignleft" readability=2><p><span class=visually-hidden>Courtesy of Big Machine Records</span></p>Courtesy of Big Machine Records<p>loading...</p></figure><p>Brooks' new song will be included on the track list of his upcoming <a href=#>Time Traveler</a><a href=#> album</a>, which he announced in late October. The full project's due out Nov. 7, but fans will only be able to buy it at one store: Brooks is selling Time Traveler as part of a seven-disc box set exclusively with Bass Pro Shops.</p><p>It's already available to pre-order on the company's <a href=#>website</a>. Time Traveler consists of 10 tracks, and the box set also includes albums like Fun, Gunslinger, Man Against Machine and the three-disc Triple Live project.</p><p>"There are a lot of different eras on this album, thus the name," Brooks explained when he announced the release of Time Traveler. "Country music's core is sincerity; after that you can dress it up a thousand different ways. I am so lucky to live under the flag of country music."</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>See Inside Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood's Malibu Beach House:</h2><a href=#>Garth Brooks</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Trisha Yearwood</a>'s former beachside house in Malibu offered a gorgeous vacation paradise for the country music power couple to relax.<p>Brooks and Yearwood bought their 4-bedroom, 3.5-bathroom, 4,200-square-foot house in Malibu for slightly less than $5 million in June of 2008. The house itself is fairly modest, but very well-appointed, featuring an open floor plan.</p><p>The living room boasts a corner fireplace and multiple sets of French doors that open to the backyard. The kitchen includes marble countertops, while skylights offer plenty of natural California sunlight. The den features floor-to-ceiling bookshelves on either side of a fireplace of white brick.</p><p>The backyard is spectacular, featuring a loggia, an outdoor fireplace, a half-court basketball court and elaborate landscaping. The house provides direct access to the world-famous Malibu beach via a set of steps.</p><p>The couple sold the house in Malibu in late 2016 for $7 million.</p><p class=photogallery-credit>Gallery Credit: <a href=#>Sterling Whitaker</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmoJmiqbVurtGopqSrXae8r7rInmSdrZ6jerO7w56mZqWRo3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
