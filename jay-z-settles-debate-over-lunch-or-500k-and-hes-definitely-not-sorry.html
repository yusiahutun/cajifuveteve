He then told users to go buy his albums with the money.</p><p>“If you piece it together and really listen to the music for the words, for what it is, it’s all there. Everything that I said was going to happen, happened. Everything that I said I wanted to do, I’ve done, and there’s the blueprint,” he concluded.</p><p>Upon the revelation, fans rushed to social media to discuss the ‘ending’ of the years-long debate.</p><p>“Even Jay Z keeps telling y’all to take the money but here y’all go wanting lunch with this man thinking he’s gonna tell y’all something revolutionary worth more than what you’re gonna get up front,” penned one.</p><p>Another laughed: “Even Jay Z telling yall stupid selves to take that 500k vs having lunch with him, he said the wisdom is in his music for $10.99.”</p><p>“Lmao Jay Z said if it was him he’d take the money over lunch with him, I know that’s right,” tweeted one.</p><p>Well, we guess the debate is now settled and closed!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jay-z-s-net-worth-is-in-the-billions-but-he-s-still-not-on-forbes-400-list>JAY-Z’s net worth is in the billions – but he’s still not on Forbes’ 400 List</h2><p>It’s no surprise many would choose to have lunch with Jay, as his net worth stands at a whopping $2.5 billion, Forbes <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reports</a>.</p><p>However, a huge sum like that still isn’t enough to get the star into the Top 400 richest in the nation, and he’s not the only <a href=#>celebrity</a> to miss out.</p><p>Oprah Winfrey ($2.8 billion) also missed out on a spot for the third year in a row, after previously making the list for 25 years straight.</p><p>As well as his own hits, JAY-Z founded Roc-A-Fella Records in 1995, after being unable to land a recording contract with a major record label.</p><p>However, it seems like he had the last laugh, with the label, and his own tracks landing him a net worth in the billions. In fact, by the late 1990s, he’d already made his first millions.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2eAcLbAsmSzZaOawbW4xKxknZ2SlsGmec6vnKtlnKq7pLSMqKlmbWBluG6tzZ1koZ2jYrGmssinoK2dnK56r7vTZqqoqqKufA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
