For instance, how did they meet? Why did they break up? Are they still talking to each other now?</p><h3>1999: First encounter</h3><p class=align-left>The two met in a cast of <i>Pushing Tin</i> in 1999. Angelina was staring as Marry Bell while Billy Bob was portraying Russell Bell. In other words, they featured as a couple in the comedy-drama<a href=#> film</a>. Little did they knew they were destined to be a pair a few months later.</p><p class=align-left>Both of them had their histories. Billy Bob had married five times before he met with Angelina. Furthermore, during that time, he was engaged to Laura Dern – an actress and filmmaker. On the other hand, Angelina had divorced her first husband and was seeing Timothy Hutton, who is an actor and director.</p><h3>The early 2000s: Wedding in Las Vegas</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/faad0f26a780a0fa.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert divorce story: What really happened</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ec0b422b381d0076.jpg><p class=align-left>Between January and May of 2000, the two were convinced they were meant for each other. They resolved to make it official through a wedding. Many were left in shock, considering they had shortly known each other.</p><p class=align-left>In May, the two booked an appointment with a minister in LA, who helped them to make their marriage official. Angelina was wearing jeans instead of a gown during her big day. This is probably why some people did not take them seriously.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong><a id=https://tuko.co.ke/311241-kaitlyn-leeb-ethnicity-husband-family-net-worth.html href=#>Muigai wa Njoroge wives photos and relationship story</a></p><p class=align-left>As mentioned early, Thornton was engaged to Laura Dern. Even so, he went ahead to tie the knot with Angie. It came as a surprise for her because she was away making a movie. Speaking in an interview with Talk magazine, <a id="https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=115276&page=1" href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the actress said</a>,</p>I left our home to work on a movie, and while I was away, my boyfriend got married, and I’ve never heard from him again.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/35d09a1de5c48f33.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jill Diven: 5 interesting things about Brad Garrett's ex-wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>She added,</p>It’s like a sudden death. For no one has there been any closure or clarity.<p class=align-left>Interestingly, during the time of their wedding, Angie had already tattooed the name of Billy Bob on her arm. Also, she was not bothered by their significant age gap. However, it is not clear whether she knew that her husband-to-be was engaged to someone else or not.</p><h3>June and July 2000: Too much love to be true</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/faad0f26a780a0fa.jpg><p class=align-left>After their wedding, the couple started to appear on the covers of several magazines. For instance, they were featured on US Weekly and Rolling Stone. According to the story published by <a id=https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/tbt-with-us-podcast-angelina-jolie-and-billy-bob-thorntons-wild-2000-interview/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">US Weekly</a>, their love was excessively charming to the extent they were afraid it was going to ‘kill’ them.</p><p class=align-left>Similarly, Rolling Stone in July covered their love story from another angle. They describe their marriage as dangerous but yet pleasurable. The cover of the magazine read, <i>Inside America’s Most Dangerous Marriage: Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic.</i></p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/36b27bb85c20177c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Pascal Tokodi, Grace Ekirapa celebrate 1st wedding anniversary in colourful ceremony</span></p></a><h3>July 2001: Angelina Jolie and Billy Bob Thornton blood vial</h3><p class=align-left>Their marriage became interesting with time. Due to their busy work schedules, they devised means of feeling close to each other even when they were far apart. Angie came with the idea of necklaces.</p><p class=align-left>They sliced their fingers and smeared their blood in the lockets. They exchanged them, and they had to wear the necklaces around their necks all the time. To them, it was a romantic gesture.</p><p class=align-left>Again, Angelina Jolie and Billy Bob Thornton necklaces put their relationship on the spotlight. Some considered the idea weird because of the blood vials. Addressing the issue in an <a id=https://people.com/movies/billy-bob-thornton-marriage-angelina-jolie-blood-necklaces/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with People magazine</a>, the actor said,</p>The necklaces were a very simple thing, ‘Hey let’s poke our fingers with a pen and smear a little blood on there and when we’re away from each other we’ll wear the necklace.’ It was that easy. But by the time it came out in the press it sounded like we were wearing a bucket of blood around our necks.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6a0374a176a7e561.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Afton Smith: Brendan Fraser divorce story and latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Annitah Raey real names, life story, and quick facts</p><h3>2002: Plan to adopt a child</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/31deca74dbe4a91b.jpg><p class=align-left>Two years into their marriage, the stars announced that they were planning to <a href=#>adopt a child</a>. They reportedly travelled to Cambodia together. While there, they visited an orphanage. They found a young and handsome boy, Maddox, whom Angie adopted.</p><p class=align-left>Later, it was revealed that Angie adopted Maddox as a single mother as opposed to their initial plan – joint adoption. It now became clear that the two were having some issues with their marriage.</p><h3>2002 – 2003: Trouble in paradise</h3><p class=align-left>After the failed joint adoption in 2002, the stars started to have problems with their marriage. Some speculated that Billy had cheated on her with a sex therapist. However, no one commented on the infidelity issue.</p><p class=align-left>Unable to tolerate each other anymore, the two called it quits. They initiated plans for divorce, which were finalized in March 2003.

Angelina Jolie, on the other hand, is a social person who always loves to travel around the world.</p><p class=align-left>At first, he felt like he was not good enough for her. Later, in 2018, when asked about the cause of their break with the female star, <a id=https://www.goldenglobes.com/articles/hfpa-conversation-billy-bob-thornton-film-music-and-sports href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bob said</a>,</p>We just had different lifestyles.
