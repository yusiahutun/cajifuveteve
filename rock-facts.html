Each type is formed through different geological processes, which contributes to their distinct characteristics.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-2>Igneous Rocks: Formed from Fire</h2><p>Igneous rocks form from cooled magma or lava. This process can occur either above (extrusive) or below (intrusive) the Earth’s surface. Notable examples include basalt and granite.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-3>Sedimentary Rocks: Pages of Earth’s History</h2><p>Sedimentary rocks are formed over millions of years as small particles like sand, silt, and clay accumulate and harden. These rocks often form in layers, each of which represents a snapshot of the Earth’s history.</p><p>Read also: <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><span>9 Surprising Facts About SnowCapped Mountains</span></a></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-4>Metamorphic Rocks: Transformed by Pressure and Heat</h2><p>Metamorphic rocks begin as either igneous or sedimentary rocks, but they undergo a transformation due to extreme heat and pressure. This process changes the rock’s physical and chemical properties. Marble, for example, is a metamorphic rock formed from limestone.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-5>The Rock Cycle Connects Them All</h2><p>The rock cycle is a continuous process that changes one rock type to another. It illustrates how through melting, erosion, sedimentation, and metamorphosis, rocks are continuously created, altered, and destroyed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Woman-looking-at-landscape-at-the-edge-of-a-ravine-730x548.jpeg><h2 class=content-title id=title-6>Some Rocks Float</h2><p>Yes, you read that right! Pumice, a type of igneous rock, can float on water. This is due to its unique formation process, which involves rapid cooling and depressurization of gas-rich magma, creating a rock filled with air bubbles.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-7>Rocks Can Grow</h2><p>Certain types of rocks, like gypsum and other evaporite minerals, can grow over time. This happens when mineral-saturated water evaporates, leaving behind mineral deposits that accumulate and form rock.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-8>Oldest Known Rocks</h2><p>The oldest rocks on Earth, called zircons, are about 4.4 billion years old. They were discovered in Western Australia and provide a glimpse into our planet’s early days.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-9>Birthstones are Rocks</h2><p>Birthstones, often used in jewelry, are specific types of rocks or minerals. For example, diamond (April’s birthstone) is a form of carbon, and amethyst (February’s birthstone) is a type of quartz.</p><p>Read also: <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><span>10 Facts About Blizzards</span></a></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-10>Rocks in Your Kitchen</h2><p>Many kitchen countertops are made from granite, an igneous rock known for its durability and beautiful patterns. So, you might be cooking on a piece of Earth’s inner history!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Rocks-background.jpeg><h2 class=content-title id=title-11>The Grand Canyon: A Geological Wonderland</h2><p>The <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Grand Canyon</a> is a treasure trove for geologists, showcasing nearly two billion years of Earth’s geological history in its vibrant layers of exposed rock.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-12>Gold in Quartz</h2><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Gold</a> often forms within <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>quartz</a>, a common mineral found in igneous and metamorphic rocks. This precious metal is deposited within the quartz veins by hot, mineral-rich fluids.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-13>The Earth’s Crust is Mostly Rock</h2><p>Approximately 95% of the Earth’s crust is composed of igneous and metamorphic rocks, with sedimentary rocks making up the remaining 5%.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-14>Meteorites: Rocks from Space</h2><p>Meteorites are chunks of rock that have fallen to Earth from space. Scientists study these extraterrestrial rocks to learn more about the universe beyond our planet.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-15>Moon Rocks on Earth</h2><p>During the Apollo moon missions, astronauts brought back 842 pounds of lunar rocks to Earth. These moon rocks have helped scientists better understand the Moon’s geology and the common history it shares with Earth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Fragment-of-granite-on-a-white-background.jpeg><h2 class=content-title id=title-16>Rocks as Tools</h2><p>The earliest tools used by humans were made of rock. The Stone Age gets its name from the stone tools and weapons crafted by early humans.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-17>The Diamond Planet</h2><p>There’s a planet made largely of diamonds! The exoplanet 55 Cancri e is thought to be composed of <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>diamond</a> and graphite (both forms of <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>carbon</a>), as well as other elements.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-18>Some Rocks Glow</h2><p>Under ultraviolet light, some minerals in rocks glow, a phenomenon known as fluorescence. This can make for an impressive display in a dark room!</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-19>Rocks Under the Ocean</h2><p>The ocean floor isn’t just made of dirt and sand; there’s plenty of rock down there, too. Basalt is the most common rock type in the oceanic crust.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-20>The Matterhorn: A Famous Rock</h2><p>One of the most famous rocks in the world is the <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# title=Matterhorn data-wpil-keyword-link=linked data-wpel-link=internal>Matterhorn</a> in the Swiss Alps. This majestic mountain is made of metamorphic rocks – gneiss and schist.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Lunar-Olivine-Basalt-15555-from-Apollo-15.jpeg><h2 class=content-title id=title-21>Conclusion</h2><p>Rocks are truly incredible. They’re time capsules, carrying the history of our planet within their layers, and they’re as diverse as the Earth’s many landscapes. They glow, they float, they grow – they’re anything but “just rocks.” Hopefully, these 20 fun facts about rocks inspire you to look a little closer the next time you pass a pebble on your path. After all, you never know what story it might have to tell.</p><p>Read also: <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><span>14 Astounding Facts About Aquatic Ecosystems</span></a></p><h3>Was this page helpful?</h3><p class=why-trust><span>Our commitment to delivering trustworthy and engaging content is at the heart of what we do.
