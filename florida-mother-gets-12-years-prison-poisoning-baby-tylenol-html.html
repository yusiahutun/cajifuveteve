Because vulnerable people are the victims, MSBP is a form of child abuse or elder abuse.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>The caregiver with MSBP may:</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Victims are most often small children. They may get painful medical tests they don't need. They may even become seriously ill or injured or may die because of the actions of the caregiver.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Children who are victims of MSBP can have lifelong physical and emotional problems and may have Munchausen syndrome as adults. This is a disorder in which a person causes or falsely reports his or her own symptoms.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Doctors aren't sure what causes it, but it may be linked to problems during the abuser's childhood. Abusers often feel like their life is out of control. They often have poor self-esteem and can't deal with stress or anxiety.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>The attention that caregivers get from having a sick child may encourage their behavior. Caregivers may get attention not only from doctors and nurses but also from others in their community. For example, neighbors may try to help the family in many ways-such as by doing chores, bringing meals, or giving money.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold><span class=mol-style-italic>SOURCE: UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN&nbsp;</span></span></p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/gb/news/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span><p class=mol-para-with-font>On the third visit, just a month later, Taylor said her daughter had eating issues.
