In it, the demon Pazuzu possesses a little girl, Regan, after she plays with a Ouija board, causing her to mutilate herself with a crucifix and expel vulgarities at her family. The film reinforces the Catholic fear of the Other — Pazuzu is the king of demons in the ancient Middle Eastern Sumerian religion — and pits the patriarchal powers of God against the patriarchal powers of hell. Through it all, Regan has no agency, and her body becomes a battlefield for men’s faith — a truly relevant horror in today’s political climate.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clgcispd6004l3b6vigjp4j05@published data-word-count=71><a href=#>William Friedkin</a>, a notorious perfectionist, helmed this adaptation of William Blatty’s novel, and he had a clear vision of how its events should unfold. Mirroring the dogged determination of The Exorcist’s priests, Friedkin often pushed his actors past their limits, even resulting in injuries for Linda Blair, who played Regan.

While he and his wife are living in Rome, her pregnancy ends in a stillbirth at the same time another woman dies during childbirth. At the hospital chaplain Father Spiletto’s behest, Thorn swaps out the babies without informing his wife. This initial horror — of a husband lying to his wife about the identity and fate of their child — foreshadows the terrors to come.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clgcispd7004q3b6vld6v3lgw@published data-word-count=71>Five years later, mysterious tragedies begin to unfold; a hellhound appears to keep guard of their son, Damien; and his nanny hangs herself at his birthday party after shouting, “It’s all for you, Damien!” That’s just the beginning — Thorn revisits Father Spiletto and deduces his child is the Antichrist. How could God let this happen? It’s a betrayal akin to Thorn’s original choice, setting the stage for an approaching apocalypse.</p>Available on Cinemax <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Cinemax</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clgcispd8004s3b6vdc04ftqf@published>Prince of Darkness (1987)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clgcispd8004u3b6v8q4klsg2@published data-word-count=72>The great John Carpenter is celebrated for films like Halloween (1978) and The Thing (1982), but his oft-overlooked Prince of Darkness is one of the stranger entries in his filmography, and that’s saying something. After a container of ancient liquid is discovered in a monastery, a Catholic priest, played by genre favorite Donald Pleasence, enlists the help of some quantum-physics students to pinpoint what exactly this eerie green substance is made of.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clgcispd8004v3b6v8vt1rt3i@published data-word-count=66>After deciphering a text accompanying the liquid’s canister, the group discovers it’s Satan in juice form. Soon students get possessed, students murder other students, and Jesus was actually an alien? Carpenter explores the idea that science and religion are merely two different ways of interpreting the same phenomenon — and though that phenomenon is both real and reducible to its concrete parts, it is still inescapable.</p>Available on Peacock <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Peacock</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clgcispd9004x3b6vzc9tdcol@published>The Exorcist III (1990)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clgcispd9004z3b6vknjo1jq4@published data-word-count=80>We don’t talk about Exorcist II: The Heretic (1977). The first Exorcist sequel, which follows Regan’s adolescence following the first film’s possession, was such a disappointment that it took 13 years to get William Blatty’s novelized screenplay Legion (the final installment in his “Faith Trilogy”) adapted to the screen. When a final cut of the Legion adaptation did make it to the studio, higher-ups balked since it contained no actual exorcism, and the film underwent more shoots and extensive edits.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clgcispd900503b6v542rqjyz@published data-word-count=86>Considering all of the fiascos with production, the final product, serving as direct sequel to the original and ignoring Exorcist II entirely, not only features genre favorites like George C. Scott and Brad Dourif but contains one of the best jump scares ever put to screen. It also ponders a couple big questions: Even if a person is selfless and devout, are there forces after death that will punish them for their piety? Is God truly the only power, or does Satan have a say too?</p>Available on Hulu <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Hulu</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clgcispd900523b6v4tsh3dbq@published>The Day of the Beast (1995)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clgcispd900543b6vf5b4qmrj@published data-word-count=51>In Madrid, a priest named Ángel starts sinning in any way he can, even employing the help of Satanist and metalhead José María to scale his efforts.

A frantic, frenzied plot unfolds as Ángel and José María kidnap a televangelist and attempt to summon Satan. It’s a satirical take on the role of faith and devotion in present-day believers — would any modern Catholics sacrifice themselves for the salvation of all?

In fact, they appeal to the Catholic Church in the original The Conjuring movie and are denied a priest since the family experiencing the possession isn’t part of the congregation. Gatekept in the bowels of Catholic dogma, the strict rituals and rules for a successful exorcism will not be used to aid outsiders. The price of piety must be paid for protection — gotta love Catholic dogma.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clgcispdb005e3b6v7hczwtb2@published data-word-count=48>To overcome the Church’s indifference to their plight, Ed Warren takes it upon himself to perform the dangerous exorcism despite his lack of priesthood.

Instead of focusing on demons and exorcisms, the plot of this film begins with a miracle in a church located in the Devon countryside of South West England. The Vatican sends a group of investigators — whose number, notably, does not include a priest — to verify the claims and assess the supernatural events. Quite quickly, the environment within the church and surrounding town grows sinister, and the local priest dies by suicide.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clgcispdc005j3b6vh8207xtv@published data-word-count=50>Making deft use of the found-footage setup, The Borderlands uses science and technology to take viewers on a wild ride through skepticism tested by measurable evidence and the outcome of only subscribing to “seeing is believing.” After all, what if you find out your assumptions were wrong much too late?</p>Available on Tubi <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Tubi</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clgo0n135000q3b76ygefm1vt@published>Evil (2019-)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clgo0n0vw000o3b76jp098gp3@published data-word-count=55>Evil is the modern successor to The X-Files, a frequently horror-tinged case-of-the-week series complete with a skeptical female doctor and the devout believer. But, Evil trades The X-Files sci-fi spooks for Catholic creeps. Psychiatrist Dr. Kristen Bouchard is tasked with differentiating demonic possession from mental illness alongside David Acosta, a former journalist turned Catholic priest-in-training.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clgo0n0vx000p3b76eanmhkw1@published data-word-count=83>Outside of the scary moments and demonic images contained in each possession-of-the-episode storyline, the overarching terror comes from Dr. Bouchard’s rival Dr. Leland Townsend. Leaning into the ever-present specter of Catholic guilt, Dr. Townsend revels in bringing that guilt full circle and enticing others to commit evil. And, he’s particularly intrigued by the seemingly incorruptible Acosta — Dr. Townsend, like the devil, loves a challenge. At its core, Evil examines temptation and corruption — and what happens when good people are led astray.</p>Available on Paramount+ <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Paramount+</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clgcispdc005k3b6vpoh0yk9r@published>The Cleansing Hour (2019)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clgcispdc005m3b6vthhdmsn2@published data-word-count=69>In this day and age of content creators and livestreams, isn’t a fake priest streaming fake exorcisms to sell merch (including fake holy water) basically a given? That’s the premise of The Cleansing Hour, and “Father” Max and Drew, the two friends behind the sacrilegious scheme, have managed to amass a large following doing so. Their viewership loves the spectacle of the Church without subscribing to its rigid dogma.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clgcispdd005n3b6vasuppn3n@published data-word-count=129>But when the actor hired to play the possessed person for the next episode doesn’t show, Drew’s fiancée reluctantly agrees to stand in. Unfortunately, a demon decides this is the night to convert The Cleansing Hour into reality and possesses her. As the night wears on and more and more of the crew dies, the demon forces Max and Drew to reveal secrets to the streaming audience — from the true nature of the show to Catholic-school atrocities to interpersonal infidelities. It’s the creeping dread ingrained into any lapsed Catholic — or any denomination, for that matter — that their abandoned belief system will prove real and the guilt, shame, and truth of amassed wrongdoings will come out in a public forum.

During this sequence, Father Amorth’s cunning and wit is on full display, proving this exorcist has modern sensibilities and unorthodox methods against ancient evils. But, it turns out, this first exorcism is purely “theater” put on by Father Amorth to quell the disturbed young man’s troubled mind.
