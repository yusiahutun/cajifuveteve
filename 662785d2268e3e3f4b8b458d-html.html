Reflecting on his experience facing Tyson during an interview with Sports Illustrated in 2010, McNeeley emphasized the sheer power of <strong>Tyson</strong>'s punches.</p><p>"At the weigh-in, I was 224Ibs and he was 220," he recalled.</p><p>"They reweighed us one hour before the fight, after we'd both burned off a lot of nervous energy warming up. He was 216! I was 220.</p><p>"Mike Tyson at 216 is all [expletive] speed. The punches that hurt you the worst are the ones that you don't see.</p><p>"It was just crazy. When I met with him much later, he was 240. He was huge. And when I fought him, he was all ripped up."</p><p>The actual fight was short-lived. It was officially stopped when McNeeley's manager, <strong>Vinnie Vecchione</strong>, entered the <a href=#><strong>boxing</strong></a> ring to prevent further damage to his fighter, who had been knocked down twice in the opening round.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jpumsaGenHxzfJFtZmlsX2eAcIKVa25xbZRnf3eExGycbJ5kl4WjgJRxm2egpKK5</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
