 The TV star made his debut as Logan during Monday night's episode (January 29) of the BBC soap, appearing as a bully causing trouble for Denzel (Jaden Ladega). After an altercation in the chicken shop, Logan and his gang cornered Denzel and attacked him. When Yolande (Angela Wynter) rushed over to help, she tripped and the bullies filmed her as they continued beating Denzel."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In other shots, Liam can be seen posing completely naked, flashing his bare bottom in view of his followers.</p><p>The soap star's latest bum-baring display came in October 2023 as he celebrated his 27th birthday. Holding onto a Greece flag, Liam ditched his clothes as he looked out onto the picturesque view.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31979163.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_maxbowden.jpg><p>He captioned the cheeky shot: "The tradition that always gives… #27. Thank you everyone for the birthday wishes and gifts, you are the best." With Liam looking far older than his soap character, viewers couldn't help but question why he had been cast in a role meant for a teenager.</p><p>On X, formerly known as Twitter, one person said: "That new kid looks about 40." A second added: "Why is this school boy actually 50 years old pls." A third weighed in: "Why is #eastenders casting people in their late 20s to play teenagers all of a sudden?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>Another penned: "There's a 'teenager' in today's episode of #<a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>EastEnders</a> that looks at least five years older than me. I am 34." A fifth wrote: "That guy wearing school uniform looks about 30." Meanwhile someone else joked: "Almost certain that this school boy sold me my mortgage…"</p><p>Liam appeared to see the funny side of the comments as he sent a response to fans on his Instagram Stories. Sharing shots from his scene, Liam wrote: "The most talked about bully on the street. (Ps... I don't sell mortgages)" followed by a laughing emoji.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32004012.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_staapp_392796678_284204674445427_3670157356504951909_n_1080.jpg><p>Denzel's altercation with Logan and his gang begins to take its toll on him. During Tuesday's episode (January 30), Denzel is humiliated by the video showing him failing to protect Yolande.
