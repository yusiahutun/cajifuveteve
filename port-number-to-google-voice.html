If you want to port your current phone number over, however, there are a few things you need to be aware of. Here’s how you can transfer your number over to Google Voice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-would-you-port-a-mobile-number-to-google-voice>Why Would You Port a Mobile Number to Google Voice?</h2><p>When purchasing a phone plan from a new carrier, you will usually be assigned a new number. If you are interested in keeping your old number, an easy way to do so is to port it to Google Voice.</p><h3 id=the-advantages-of-google-voice>The Advantages of Google Voice</h3><p>The single <a href=#>largest advantage that Google Voice offers</a> is cost. If you’re interested in keeping an old number in addition to a new one, porting it over is the simplest way to avoid paying for a pair of plans.</p><p>There are many reasons why you might want to retain your old number. If you have contacts who need to get in touch with you at your old number, it may be worth saving temporarily. It can also be worthwhile to keep separate phone numbers for personal and professional purposes. If your old number is plagued by spam calls, however, you may simply want the <a href=#>filtering services that Voice offers</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=potential-issues-when-porting-a-number-to-google-voice>Potential Issues When Porting a Number to Google Voice</h3><p>There are a few things to consider before you start the porting process. First, is the one-time $20 charge when you bring the number over. In almost all cases, however, this will be far less than the long-term cost of keeping the old number active.</p><p>The second thing to consider before you port is that Google Voice is not a stand-alone phone service. Making use of the app does require an internet connection, whether Wi-Fi or cellular. This means that even though Google offers the service free of charge, it isn’t an on-the-go replacement for a standard cell phone.</p><p>Finally, depending on who your current carrier is, porting your number over to Voice may auto-cancel your current service. The request is sent to your service provider, and many will automatically cancel your service if they receive it.</p><p>This means if you are completely leaving your old carrier, you will need to have your new contract firmly established before you make the request. Additionally, make sure that you know about any penalties you might incur from your provider before you start the process.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-to-create-a-google-voice-account>How to Create a Google Voice Account</h2><p>If you don’t already have a Voice account through Google, you’ll need to set one up before you port your existing number.

If you already have an account set up, then feel free to skip ahead to <strong>Porting Your Number to Google Voice</strong>.</p><h3 id=getting-started-with-google-voice>Getting Started With Google Voice</h3><p>The first step in the setup process is to access the main page for <a href=#>Google Voice</a>. Here, you’ll be greeted with two options, personal or business use. Select whichever option is best suited for what you’ll be using the service for:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/google-voice-about-page.jpg><p>For the purposes of this article, we will be signing up for an account for personal use. Clicking on the button will bring up a drop-down where you can select your platform.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Selecting Android or iOS will send you to the Google Play Store and the Apple Store pages for the Voice app. Choosing Web will take you directly to the signup process. If you already have a Google account, then you’ll be able to skip most of the process.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/google-voice-signup-page.jpg><p>Click on the continue button to move on to the next step. You’ll be prompted to search for a number to use as your Google Voice number. You can either select a nearby city from the dropdown or enter a zip code of your choosing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/google-voice-number-search.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=attaching-google-voice-to-your-current-phone-number>Attaching Google Voice to Your Current Phone Number</h3><p>Once you’ve selected a phone number, you’ll be prompted for your existing number.

If you do, you may not be able to continue porting it later on.

Enter it into the boxes, and you’ll be brought to the next step in the process. At this point, Google will perform a check to ensure that your number can be ported over.</p><p>Some carriers will not allow the number to be released, and as a result, your number may not be available. If it is, you'll automatically be directed to the next step in the process.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here, you will be offered several checkboxes to agree to. Each is attached to a different part of the porting policy. You’ll need to check each before you can move forward with the process. Once you click to continue, Google will begin the mostly automated steps to move the number.</p><p>You will need to enter some personal information as it appears on your current carrier contract to authorize the release. The exact info required depends on who your current carrier is.</p><p>Once the request can go through, you’ll be directed to the final step in the process, paying the fee. Once you make the payment, your provider is alerted and your part is done.</p><p>It may take up to 24 hours for the transfer to finish up, and during that time, you won’t have access to that number. Make sure that anyone who may need to get a hold of you in that period has access to your new phone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can check the process by returning to your main Voice dashboard. On arrival, a status message at the top of the page will inform you that you currently have a port in progress. Once this message disappears, your old phone number will automatically be attached to your voice account.​​​​​​​</p><h2 id=google-voice-enables-you-to-have-multiple-numbers-attached-to-one-phone>Google Voice Enables You to Have Multiple Numbers Attached to One Phone</h2><p>Once you’ve taken the steps to port your phone number to Google Voice, you can attach it to your new phone.
