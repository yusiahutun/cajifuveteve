It’s softer than minimalism, but more polished than normcore. It’s off-duty Olsen twins mixed with Sienna Miller in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a38939241/anatomy-of-a-scandal-pictures-plot-air-date/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Anatomy of a Scandal" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Anatomy of a Scandal</a>. It’s Jennifer Aniston in another well-cut black dress, or Amal Clooney in a beautifully tailored suit. It’s old money, ‘stealth wealth’ and discretion rolled into one. In short, it’s difficult to pin down in a few words, which is part of its appeal: nothing truly luxurious was ever easily won.</p><img alt="anatomy of a scandal, sienna miller" title="Anatomy of a Scandal, Sienna Miller" width=3840 height=1746 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pre-release-sophie-2-642d7d22672c7.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Netflix</span><p>Sienna Miller in the Netflix series Anatomy of a Scandal is a prime example of quiet luxury</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The inconspicuous aesthetic of ‘quiet luxury’ has been neatly exemplified in the intersection of two, much-discussed recent cultural moments: <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/a43448755/burberry-tote-succession/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Greg’s date sporting a ludicrously capacious Burberry tote in the new season of Succession" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Greg’s date sporting a ludicrously capacious Burberry tote in the new season of Succession</a>, and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a43479853/gwyneth-paltrow-celebrity-court-wardrobe-power-move/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gwyneth Paltrow’s courtroom wardrobe" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Gwyneth Paltrow’s courtroom wardrobe</a>. The former – brash, inappropriate, the clunky wielding of a brand name like a weapon – is categorically not ‘quiet luxury’, while the latter – soft leather, delicate jewellery and head-to-toe (unshowy, unbranded) designer pieces – is perhaps the most fully-formed version of the aesthetic.</p><img alt="gwyneth paltrow in court" title="Gwyneth paltrow in court" width=5400 height=3600 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/actress-gwyneth-paltrow-enters-the-courtroom-on-march-22-in-news-photo-1680420121.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Rick Bowmer</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Gwyneth Paltrow in court in Utah, wearing the muted tones and unidentifiable designer pieces synonymous with quiet luxury</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Highlights from the autumn/winter 2023 shows" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/kendall-jenner-vittoria-ceretti-rianne-van-rompaey-gigi-news-photo-1678470005-6410a0e9d2a71.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In its essence, ‘quiet luxury’ has many of the same hallmarks as ‘classic’: well-made, muted staples that don't shout about their provenance, but rather quietly communicate a low-key, but undeniably high-end, unfussiness. It’s about mixing an eye-wateringly expensive coat with baggy, vintage jeans; wearing multiple shades of beige at once; an expensive watch just peeking out from under the cuff of a thick, cream jumper. It’s about quality over quantity and having the instinctive style and confidence to invest in wear-for-life pieces.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"More than a trend, ‘quiet luxury’ is frustratingly amorphous"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There’s no point denying that ‘quiet luxury’ looks, from the outset, like a fashion moment directed at the mega-rich (after all, layers of softly-spun oatmeal cashmere don’t come cheap). But its real meaning goes deeper: ‘quiet luxury’ is, in fact, a whole mindset for living. It’s showing an inclination towards premium basics – not just in your wardrobe, but in every aspect of your life. Certain small touches can be ‘quiet luxury’ through and through, and at a surprisingly low price point.</p><img alt="with the sale of waystar royco inching ever closer, who will end up on top the fourth and final season of the emmy winning drama begins" title=Succession width=5931 height=4448 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/succession-2-64240683a154e.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Home Box Office</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Sky</span><p>The billionaire Roy family in Succession are known for their unfussy, inconspicuous wardrobes</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At home, ‘quiet luxury’ is enjoyed by yourself, not displayed for the approval of others. It's fluffy towels and an oversized bathrobe (preferably warmed on a radiator or rail). It’s plenty of cosy throws – cashmere if you can, of course – and a fire, either electric or real. It’s lots of eclectic furniture, from expensive antiques to personal, jumble-sale finds, each piece with its own story. It’s having decades-old but still beautiful copper pots and pans, a playlist on a Bose sound system and a Smythson notebook (taking another cue from Paltrow) on your well-worn, wooden desk.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When it comes to beauty and wellness, ‘quiet luxury’ is ultimately about looking after yourself. It's high-maintenance, so that you can be low-maintenance: think regular facials for glowing skin; twice-monthly manicures and pedicures; whitened, straightened teeth (but not blindingly so); and a timeless haircut and colour (that, importantly, suits you), rather than what’s been seen on the runway. ‘Quiet luxury’ is having a skincare routine (it might even be an affordable French pharmacy brand you swear by) and doing regular exercise – whether that’s a top-tier Pilates class or running in the park. It’s taking care of your mental health by meditating, reading a book or listening to a podcast. It's long, bracing dog walks and weekends with your family. After all, time is one of the greatest and hardest-won luxuries.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Perhaps the most obvious indicator of ‘quiet luxury’, however, isn’t what you have, or what you wear – it’s the way you act. The low-key luxe woman doesn’t wait in line for a table at the latest buzzy restaurant, she hosts her friends at home for an intimate dinner. She sends thoughtful cards and flowers (not big, showy bouquets but seasonal bunches) for birthdays. She donates to charities, volunteers her time or supports causes that she believes in without shouting about it or requiring recognition. She doesn’t boast about where she’s going on holiday, and she certainly won't share it on social media (if she even has Instagram at all). But most of all, she’s quietly confident not just in her wardrobe, her style and her social life, but in herself – which, some might argue, is the biggest luxury of all.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwr9Slq66qlWS5qrLErKuypJWUtbC5xKxmmmxjan53f5FxZqqtmZrBbrjUsayrsV2htqex0q2wpZ1f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
