When temperatures tank, you realize not all sweaters are created equal. And while moderate climates may be more forgiving to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>breathable cotton or polyester sweaters</a>, frigid temps and snow are going to require something more insulating. Enter the wool sweater. With their <strong>thick yarns</strong> and naturally <strong>temperature-regulating properties</strong>, wool sweaters will require less layering in order to feel toasty. “Wool also adds structure and volume,” says fashion stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Rosey Beeme</a>, which is just what you need during the winter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To help you find the best of the best, we <strong>consulted a group of experts</strong> and tried a bunch of sweaters out ourselves. We took into consideration <strong>different wool blends</strong> and specific wool types (like merino wool) because wool can sometimes be a little itchy. Whatever your preferred style may be, we found the top wool sweaters from the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>best turtlenecks</a> to crewnecks to boleros.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-athleta-alpine-turtleneck-sweater></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Athleta Alpine Turtleneck Sweater</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Alpine Turtleneck Sweater" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/w1-G_MwQ8Gt5UcV1Pyb5UWLY65Y=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/athleta-alpine-turtleneck-sweater-c6a0afcbde424d12bbfd53c7605a6f21.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Athleta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This can be thrown into the washer and dryer.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It’s quite oversized, and a lot of people are suggesting to size down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This wool turtleneck sweater has <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cashmere</a> blended in to help soften the often itchy fabric. It will be just as breathable and even pull sweat away from the body to save you from accidentally overheating if you misjudge the temperature outside or happen to have an overheated office. And although you might think that will make it harder to care for, you can still machine wash (and dry!) this sweater, which we weren't expecting — no trips to the dry clean required.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We appreciate the relaxed fit of this sweater, too. The boxy fit with ribbed hems errs on the oversized side, naturally falling to your hips, while the long sleeves give a cozy effect as they cover your hands. If you wish for a more standard fit, however, it’s recommended to size down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Wool, cashmere | <strong>Size: </strong>XXS–3XL&nbsp; | <strong>Length: </strong>Mid</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-quince-baby-alpaca-wool-diamond-stitch-crew></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Quince Baby Alpaca-Wool Diamond Stitch Crew</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Baby Alpaca-Wool Diamond Stitch Crew" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/erkR5fciz1u3eAmYUj-eo-hTjbw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/quince-alpaca-stitch-crew-f9e75d02faca4587be1069b552d708ae.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Quince</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Its incredibly soft material has awarded this piece a near-perfect five-star rating.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Some colors are a little see-through.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you don’t know Quince by now, it’s time to familiarize yourself with the brand that creates quality pieces at an affordable price. After trying one of the brand's 100 percent cashmere sweaters, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality for such a low price — and I definitely expect the same level of craftsmanship for this wool sweater, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Made of baby alpaca wool, extra-fine merino wool, and nylon, this sweater is a lightweight option that feels incredibly soft. It comes in a crewneck cut with extra long sleeves and some room to move around. However, there are a few complaints that some versions are slightly see-through, particularly the lighter color options like ivory or light gray. You will need to wear a tee or camisole underneath to combat any sheerness (or just pick a very cute bra).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Baby alpaca wool, extra fine merino wool, nylon |<strong> Size: </strong>XS–XL | <strong>Length: </strong>Mid</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-attire-the-studio-courchevel-sweater-taupe></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Attire The Studio Courchevel Sweater Taupe</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Attire The Studio Courchevel Sweater Taupe" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/j4DF0LjsWBkHyri4YNnBREQBxpI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/attire-the-studio-courchevel-sweater-taupe-a2008b5b01bb453da45d83b6d66cc43d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Attire The Studio&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s sustainably made in Italy and the 100 percent wool and thick stitching make it extremely warm.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>We wish it was offered in more colors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not only is this sweater made of 100 percent wool, but the wool Attire The Studio uses is Responsible Wool Standard (RWS) Certified, meaning that it had to undergo rigorous testing to ensure the well-being of animal welfare and land management. A sustainable piece such as this is going to come with a higher price tag, especially if you also factor in that it’s made in Italy where highly skilled workers receive a living wage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, great material alone isn’t going to sell you on this piece, so take a look at its gorgeous cable-knit pattern, oversized sleeves, and ribbing around the mock neck. Warmth is certainly guaranteed in this piece, but so is an elevated style. We love it so much, we like to shop from a wider range of colors, like black or navy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>RWS-certified wool<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size:</strong> XS–XL |<strong> Length: </strong>Mid</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-everlane-the-alpaca-crew></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Everlane The Alpaca Crew</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Everlane The Alpaca Crew" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/BRMa_No2W638tnTuiXeZ7FHs64U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Everlane-The-Alpaca-Crew-cc0ece7a7a564573b078966180100da4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Everlane</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>There is some nylon blended in to soften the fabric.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The lighter colors can be slightly see-through.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When in doubt, we shop at Everlane. They never lack color, size, or style options for everyday basics. Take this Alpaca Crew, for example. With 14 color options (including some patterned) and sizes up to 3XL, the brand ensures everyone gets to enjoy the warmth and comfort of a chic wool sweater. This piece specifically has some merino wool (they are smaller fibers, and therefore softer), alpaca wool, and nylon blended together. The nylon helps to soften the fabric (as does the merino wool), so you won’t feel that itchy sensation that wool is unfortunately known for, a fact that’s confirmed by the reviews. One thing that has been noted in said reviews, however, is that some of the lighter colors (take almond for example) are a little see-through.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Alpaca wool, merino wool, nylon<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XXS–3XL |<strong> Length: </strong>Mid</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-merino-wool-cos-slim-fit-merino-wool-turtleneck-top></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Merino Wool</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>COS Slim-Fit Merino Wool Turtleneck Top</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="COS Slim-Fit Merino Wool Turtleneck Top" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/XnrNWtLn66zKsSYL2j9dwvlLPcc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cos-slim-fit-merino-wool-turtleneck-top--b2578345866a4e79b89f51761b5198ff.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>COS&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The wool used in this sweater is certified according to the Responsible Wool Standard.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> You can't layer much underneath it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As a slightly softer and thinner fiber than regular wool, merino wool feels better on the skin and less scratchy. Because of its thinness, merino wool also lends itself to lighter, more delicate silhouettes, like this turtleneck top from Cos, rather than the chunkier pieces you probably initially think of with wool sweaters. We appreciate that Cos took the extra step to have their wool certified by the Responsible Wool Standard, too. Because of its finer texture and body-hugging fit, the sweater might be a bit challenging to layer shirts underneath; however, you can easily pile pieces on top, such as an extra jacket or cardigan if needed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Wool | <strong>Size: </strong>XS–L | L<strong>ength: </strong>Mid</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-crewneck-reformation-mer-regenerative-wool-sweater></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Crewneck</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Reformation Mer Regenerative Wool Sweater</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Reformation Mer Regenerative Wool Sweater" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/9vRi-4bLuVCS0WZek25jymMX9l8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/reformation--mer-regenerative-wool-sweater-5ec470cdf7a54beb8ca8e58115d13a8d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Reformation&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s sustainably made through regenerative farming.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There aren’t a lot of sizes offered.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Reformation</a> isn’t just a one-stop shop for all things dresses. The sustainable and trendy brand also offers a number of ready-to-wear clothes, like this cozy wool sweater. The crewneck cut is an easy-to-style yet elevated design that everyone can benefit from. The sweater has a homey oversized fit around the sleeves, which end in some ribbed patterns, much like at the hem and neckline. And in classic Reformation fashion, the wool is sourced responsibly through regenerative farming, which considers the entire farm ecosystem, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>non-profit Woolmark Company</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the size range they offer isn’t particularly wide, there is some wiggle room around the relaxed fit, making it easier to roam between sizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Wool<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL |<strong> Length: </strong>Mid</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-turtleneck-verishop-anine-bing-sydney-sweater-camel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Turtleneck</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Verishop Anine Bing Sydney Sweater Camel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="verishop Anine Bing Sydney Sweater Camel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5aKsXga1CwKVsZWSGblg3sYvPk0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/verishop-anine-bing-3ade17e9333b4758877a9b823ba06c4a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Verishop</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The alpaca helps soften the wool.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The sweater runs a little large, so sizing down might be required.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Some turtlenecks drown your face and neck in fabric — but not this sweater. The funnel turtleneck gently frames your visage, with a wide opening and a length that doesn’t fold over. I love the straight-line stitchings that make this sweater look sophisticated, and the dropped shoulders and oversized arms give it a relaxed appeal. The rest of the sweater is quite large, however – the model pictured here is five-foot-nine and wearing an extra small. It might serve you well to size down on this option. In terms of feel, Anine Bing blends alpaca wool and standard sheep’s wool here, in which the alpaca fibers help make wool yarn feel softer, and is a great option for people who are sensitive to this material.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Alpaca wool, wool, polyamide, polyacrylic | <strong>Size: </strong>XS–L |<strong> Length: </strong>Long</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-oversized-aritzia-babaton-popova-sweater></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Oversized</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Aritzia Babaton Popova Sweater</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Aritzia Babaton Popova Sweater" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/yfVdY1GsfrR18ZjEfU8auAy8Kgs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/aritzia-popova-sweater-8dd68854bf8540b3a84ed8f37ded43f9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Aritzia</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s extremely soft and warm.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>You can only hand wash this sweater.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">I had the pleasure of trying out this wool sweater, thanks to the Aritzia team. Upon taking the sweater out of the box, I was happy to learn that it resembled exactly what is pictured here — long sleeves, long hem, and exaggerated dropped shoulders. I was further impressed after putting it on and noticing there is zero itch, thanks to the fact that it’s mostly made of extra-fine merino wool. I wore it during a literal snow blizzard in Mont Tremblant, Canada, and it was one of the few things that, when combined with my puffer, could keep me warm in six-degree temperatures. Needless to say, I absolutely love this sweater now — it’s soft, warm, and flattering — both in cut and color. However, I’m reluctant to wear it as often, since hand washing is a bit tedious.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Extra fine merino wool, polyamide, yak | <strong>Size: </strong>2XS–XL&nbsp; | <strong>Length: </strong>Long</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cashmere-blend-laligne-mini-marin-sweater></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cashmere Blend</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Laligne Mini Marin Sweater</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="La Ligne Mini Marin Sweater " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/XwXd5RfjqtHq0Jv2FFAGLPi77f0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/la-lignen-mini-marin-sweater-39da518cbab140c19f311f0773611ca9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>La Ligne</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> You can add a monogram with up to three initials.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The crop might be too short on longer torsos.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This sweater is made of 30 percent cashmere and 70 percent wool, which feels like the perfect blend for optimal comfort and warmth. On top of the makeup, the chunky knit feels extra thick and cozy thanks to its seven-ply knit. And while the long sleeves and slightly cropped hem make this sweater look very cute, it’s the ability to add a personalized monogram on the sleeve that sets it apart. That, and the fact that there are fifteen stripe color combinations to choose from, as well as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">length options</a>.

But to keep things a little interesting, we’re opting for this two-piece cardigan sweater set. The first piece is a cable-knit slim-fitting tank, and the second is a relaxed bolero. Although they’re meant to be worn together, you’re pretty much getting a two-in-one deal should you wish to wear and style them separately. Stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Sarah Toshiko West </a>loves a good bolero set for its versatility. “You can wear the bolero off the shoulder to reveal the wool camisole underneath or tie around the neck or waist,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Each piece is made of 82 percent merino wool and 18 percent cashmere. In other words, it’s going to feel incredibly soft on the skin. The brand does warn that it has an oversized appeal to it, so if you wish for a more fitted look, size down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Merino wool, cashmere<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL |<strong> Length: </strong>Mid</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Feel: </strong>As a natural fiber commonly sourced from sheep, alpacas, goats, and even camels, wool helps insulate you better. Model <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Kendra Austin</a> prefers “wool to cotton during the winter, because it’s warmer and more durable while still being of high quality." Particularly if you opt for thick wool, “it adds structure and volume, compared to cotton or cashmere,” explains Beeme. Aside from providing warmth, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>wool is also naturally fire-resistant and wrinkle-resistant,</a> due to its ability to<strong> absorb moisture</strong> at its core. And yet, it sometimes comes with a bad rep for being a little itchy. The scratchy sensation that comes in certain wool sweaters is a direct result of how large the diameter of the wool strands is. Typically, this can be balanced if combined with softer materials, like cashmere or cotton. Otherwise, you want to look for labels that say extra-fine wool or merino wool, where the fibers are <strong>thinner, making them softer</strong>.</li><li><strong>Blends</strong>: You’ll find that most of the sweaters are rarely 100 percent wool, but rather a <strong>combination of several different materials</strong>, such as synthetic fibers — which we call wool blends — or cashmere. This should not be considered as “lesser” than pure wool – quite to the contrary. Combining different characteristics of yarns can actually create <strong>stronger materials</strong>. It also helps <strong>combat some of the itchiness</strong> that can come with pure wool. When mixed with cashmere, wool can lean on the soft properties of this fiber while still providing you with thick and warm characteristics of its own.<br></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is merino wool?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Merino wool comes from a specific breed of sheep, giving us thinner and thereby softer wool, which makes it more comfortable to wear directly on the skin. Its lightweight characteristics make it a great choice for summer and athletic apparel, as it works like a natural temperature regulator, absorbing and evaporating sweat when it’s hot.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Does wool shrink?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The short answer to this is yes, wool does shrink. Its natural ability to absorb moisture and heat causes it to contract, so it’s important to avoid washers and dryers unless it specifically states that it is safe to wash. “I typically turn my wool sweater inside out before washing with cold water and a mild detergent,” explains Toshiko West. “Wool is naturally antibacterial so you don’t need to wash them often,” she continues.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Luckily, if you do find yourself mistakenly throwing it in the dryer, there are some steps you can take to get your wool sweater to expand again. First, fill your sink with lukewarm water and pour a generous amount of conditioner in. Lay your wool sweater into the tub and let it soak for some time. Without rubbing or twisting, rinse the wool sweater thoroughly, then place it on a towel flat. After an hour or so, replace the towel with another dry towel, and repeat until the sweater is dry again.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How to style wool sweaters</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Given its warm properties, wool makes for a wonderful layering piece in the winter. “I personally love to pair the cozy with the sexy, so I’ll go with a long satin skirt, maybe something patterned to make it funky,” recommends Austin. “A wool cardigan with a cropped graphic tank, baggy distressed jeans or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cargo pants</a> and a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>cool leather sneaker</a> is also an everyday vibe,” she continues. Beeme loves “an oversized wool crewneck pullover tucked into a faux-leather mini skirt with some sheer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>black tights</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>loafers</a>”.
