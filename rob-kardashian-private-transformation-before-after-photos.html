Rob credited Blac Chyna with being his motivation to lose 50 pounds after he was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in 2015.</p><p id=ePYKpPBF5Zk data-wc=61>However the pair's relationship ended in 2017 and the pair became embroiled in a messy three-year-long custody battle over their daughter Dream, now six years old. Rob's relationship with Blac Chyna gained further attention due to several tumultuous legal battles. Shortly after their split Blac Chyna accused Rob of maliciously sharing nude photos of her.
