However, a new JT era could be upon us as he has cleared his <a href=#>Instagram</a> clean of pictures and changed his profile picture on the platform.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-speculate-something-might-be-coming>Fans speculate something might be coming</h2><p>On X (formerly <a href=#>Twitter</a>) fans have been wondering if new music could be on the horizon from Justin Timberlake. After not producing any new projects in more than half a decade, something might be arriving soon. Perhaps he was just taking his time to make it the best it could possibly be.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Selena Gomez’s confession over ‘quitting music’ will be tragic news for fans</a></p><p>However, others weren’t convinced and had some pretty harsh words about a potential comeback from the <a href=#>celebrity</a>.</p><p>One penned: “Singers doing this before the release of a project is so cringe.”</p><p>Another wrote: “Let’s hope it stays this way [prayer hands emoji].”</p><p>A third said: “He can delete the account too. We won’t miss him.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-justin-timberlake-could-be-releasing-new-music>Justin Timberlake could be releasing new music</h2><p>In the digital age, artists tend to clear their social media feeds when they start new projects (whether it be a film, <a href=#>TV</a> show, or new music) and this seems to be what Justin Timberlake is doing. A new album from the 42-year-old would be his sixth solo release … but could it be solo?</p><p>In the past year, Justin has reunited with his former NSYNC bandmates numerous times, including the <a href=#>MTV Video Music Awards</a> last year. They presented the Best Pop Award to a shocked <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> who asked them if they were “doing something,” which is a valid question considering they appeared without any other obvious reason.</p><p>However, a few days later the five men released a single for the latest Trolls film. But is a full-on <a href=#>music</a> reunion on the cards?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-has-justin-said-about-an-nsync-reunion>What has Justin said about an NSYNC reunion?</h2><p>Fans may be disappointed to learn the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star hasn’t said too much about a reunion. However, he did post on Instagram (before, of course, deleting it) about reuniting at the premiere of the Trolls film.</p><p>He teased in the caption: “So proud to celebrate the new @trolls&nbsp;movie and album with the crew. Gotta say this is my favorite so far [prayer hands emoji] Has been good to be back with my boys [eyes emoji].”</p><p>It had previously been claimed the boyband member was “single-handedly” stopping a reunion.</p><p>A source told Radar Online a few years ago: “Lance&nbsp;Bass&nbsp;and the other guys in the group would love to have a reunion tour and record new music but Justin is the one stopping it. He has worked so hard to establish himself as a solo artist and has no interest in going back into the past.</p><p>“If the guys want to do it without him, they are welcome, but Justin will not be part of it.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Destiny’s Child ‘reunite’ with ‘forgotten’ band members from original lineup</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2Z%2BcLbUrKuipl2ptq6uxKujmqOVYrGmuMStnKxllauys8WMrKCnn5yaeqq60q2YoKqRonqxtM6tpmaroJa%2FrLXNoGSnnadiura%2FyJxkq62dpL%2B0ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
