Kim is holding both arms in the air with an oar in one hand. Other pictures and clips ‚Äî seemingly taken by Davidson ‚Äî show Kardashian rowing in the clear, blue water, as well as taking a break to strike a couple of poses on her board.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kim Kardashian/Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Other images capture cute couple moments between the two. In one shot, Kardashian looks up at Davidson, accentuating their obvious height difference, and the duo is all smiles. Another portrait taken from above shows the two wading in the water with their arms around each other.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Stranded üìç," Kim captioned the post. In the series of pics, Kim donned a metallic silver-and-black bandeau-style swimsuit top with matching high-waisted bottoms. In the other shots, she wore black bike shorts over the bikini.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But the social media guru didn't stop there. She also uploaded a ton of hilarious videos to her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram Story</a>, in which Pete does his best to be an IG boyfriend. "Our few attempts at trying to get content coming up ..." Kim warned her 318 million followers. The recording taken by Davidson showed Kim posing in front of an idyllic beach and palm tree. Another Story post captured Kim splashing around in the water with Pete behind the camera insisting she do it again. "I can't tell if he's making fun of me?!?!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A few slides later, she shared a video in which she says "Hi!" to the camera, followed by a chuckle from Pete. This caption confirmed her suspicions, "Oh he's making fun of me," she wrote with three laugh-crying emojis.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It turns out, the Saturday Night Live alumnus ended up getting a lot of content for his girlfriend. She shared a few more clips from the water, as well as a couple recordings of the two going for a romantic bike ride. She concluded, "He turned out to be the best photog and we got the cutest pics and just had so much fun trying!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8qipGajkaexor%2FHopinZaeawLV7yqKkZqORp7Giv8eimKdllqGutLTYZqqwoZ2owqrAjKmcrZ1dma63tcOspqdlkpqupLQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
