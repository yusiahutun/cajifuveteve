Irreplaceable… a very sad day, which can only be handled by carrying his spirit forward.”</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ4BwfZFoaWlnopaxqruMpZygnZ6Zequ1zGajmpyUYrGmrcNmmK1lZ2p8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
