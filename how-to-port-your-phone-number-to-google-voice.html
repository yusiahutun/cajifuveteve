Calls to your old number will get forwarded to your new one, and you'll never miss an important call because someone forgot to update their address book.</p><p>Sure, you can get a new phone from&nbsp;Google Voice and use it for texting and call forwarding too. However, if you have an existing number that you want to use with Google Voice, you can port it to the service and use that instead.</p><h2 id=what-s-the-catch>What's the Catch?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/650x402xblock-phone-number-in-google-voice.png.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic.R1_cz5R47N.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>First, porting a phone number to Google Voice requires a one-time fee of $20.</p><p>Secondly, when you port a number to Google Voice, you can't use the Google Voice app to send text messages--it requires a data connection over&nbsp;Wi-Fi or LTE/3G. You can, however, have Google Voice forward texts to your new number. When you reply to them using your regular messaging app, they will appear to come from your Google Voice number, which is pretty cool.</p><p>The same goes for&nbsp;making and receiving calls--as long as you have call forwarding turned on, you can&nbsp;make and receive calls from your Google Voice number, even without a data connection.</p><p>Lastly, to port a number to Google Voice, you need two phone numbers:</p><ul><li>Your old phone number, which you are porting to Google Voice. This number must still be active when you start the porting process--do not cancel your account yet!</li><li>Your new phone number, to which you'll forward your Google Voice calls and texts. This can be a number on&nbsp;a new carrier, or on&nbsp;the same carrier you&nbsp;currently use.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In my case, I was switching to a new carrier (Cricket), so I just started a new account with them, and ported my Verizon number over. When I did so, Google cancelled my Verizon account for me.</p><p>If you're getting a new number on the same carrier, you'll just have to add a number to your account, after which Google Voice will cancel the old&nbsp;number for you.</p><p>Make sure you aren't in the middle of a contract, since porting your number could incur an early termination fee (ETF) from your carrier! If you aren't sure, call customer service and make sure they <a href=#>make a note on your account not to charge you an ETF</a> when you cancel.</p><h2 id=how-to-port-your-phone-number>How to Port Your Phone Number</h2><p>The first step is to head to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">www.google.com/voice</a>. If you've never used Google Voice before, you'll go through the process of accepting the terms and services agreement before you can start using it. Then you'll skip these first few steps.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're an existing user, click on the settings gear icon in the top-right corner and&nbsp;select "Settings".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen_Shot_2016-09-28_at_5_56_01_PM_stomped.jpg><p>Select the "Phones" tab if it isn't already selected.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen_Shot_2016-09-28_at_5_56_18_PM_stomped.jpg><p>Next to your current Google Voice number, click "Change/Port". Keep in mind that porting a number into Google Voice will replace your current Google Voice number after 90 days, but you can pay an extra $20 to keep that number (so you'll end up with two Voice numbers).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen_Shot1_2016-09-28_at_5_56_18_PM_stomped.jpg><p>Next, click on&nbsp;"I want to use my mobile number".

The only way to make and receive calls through your old number is to use your main phone number as a forwarding number.&nbsp;In other words, whenever someone calls your old phone number, that call will be forwarded to your main number.</p><p>To set up a forwarding number, go back to Google Voice Settings and select the "Phones" tab like you did earlier on. Only this time click on "Add another phone".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Enter in a name for your forwarding number and type in the phone number below that. You can also select whether or not you want text messages to forward as well.&nbsp;If you want to configure even more settings, click on "Show advanced settings".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Within these settings, you can get direct access to your old number's voicemail and even set when you want calls forwarded to you at certain times, sort of like Do Not Disturb (although Google Voice has an actual, separate Do Not Disturb feature). After you've customized settings, click "Save".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>After that, Google Voice will call your forwarding number to verify that you own and operate it, and you'll be prompted to enter in the two-digit number shown on the screen on your phone's keypad. Click on "Connect" to begin that process.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Once your number has been verified it will now show up under the "Phones" tab in Google Voice right below your ported number.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>You'll see a new setting here: the&nbsp;ability to receive text notifications on your forwarding number whenever someone leaves a voicemail on your old, ported number. Check the box next to this if you want to enable it.</p><p>At that point, though, your forwarding number is all set up and you're good to go. If you ever want to make a call using your old phone number, you can do so from within the Google Voice app on your smartphone (if you have a data connection), or by calling your own Google Voice number to make a call.</p><p>Title image from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Google</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhwa2hnanypu9Zmq6hloKS%2FtXnYqKyrZaCdvK%2BxjKesppqVp3q1u4ygpqifnJp6t7vInJxo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
