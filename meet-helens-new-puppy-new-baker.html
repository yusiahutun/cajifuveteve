Chevy's health began to decline, and he passed away leaving behind Baker and the big backyard to his lonesome. Though he wasn't a young&nbsp;dog anymore, his best&nbsp;days were far from over.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Screen_Shot_2022-02-25_at_4.03.54_PM.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Little did he know, January 3, 2018, would be his lucky day. Helen Napier was born. She would be his very best friend, and they would play in the backyard. Helen would roll all over his fluffy white fur, and he would delightfully let her tug his ears. Even in his old age, he was the best of boys.</p><p>Last year, Baker played with Helen for the last time and peacefully passed away. Helen was devastated to say goodbye, and ever since then, there's been a Baker-sized hole in her heart.</p><p>Erin said in her caption of the video, "Our dog Baker passed last July and anytime Helen gets tired and emotional, oh she crushes us!"</p><p>They decided to get Helen a new "animal friend," and they surprised her on their farm with New Baker.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Screen_Shot_2022-02-25_at_3.58.34_PM.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Screen_Shot_2022-02-25_at_3.58.28_PM.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Call us a little cheesy, but we wouldn't be surprised if Baker is looking down and shining with pride that his best friend finally has another furry best friend to call her own now.
