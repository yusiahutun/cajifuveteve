On Dec. 19, Author Ashley St. Clair posted on X, formerly Twitter, expressing her shock and dismay.</p><p>According to her, Delta Air Lines was flying alleged migrants on her flight from Phoenix, Arizona, to New York. “Why the hell is @delta complicit in shipping illegal migrants from border states like Arizona to New York City?” she wrote on X.</p><p>“Our own mayor (a Democrat) has begged Biden to stop sending the migrants here because we are overwhelmed. Is Delta being directed to transport these migrants, or are they willingly shipping illegal migrants to cities they know are crumbling for a paycheck from taxpayers?”</p><p>News outlets such as Newsweek have tried reaching out to Delta Air Lines and St. Clair for comments on the matter, but no response yet. Her post had more than 407,000 views, and “Delta” started trending on X. Soon enough, even Elon Musk, owner of X, was responding to St. Claire’s post.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: </strong><a href=#><strong>Unvaccinated Migrants Fuel Surge in Chickenpox Cases in Chicago</strong></a></p><p>“Good question,” Musk commented, and St. Clair responded saying, “I won’t hold my breath on them answering.” In a different post on X, St Clair said that the flight she boarded was filled with migrants who still had their luggage from a processing center.&nbsp;</p><p>“My Delta flight from Phoenix appears to be flying migrants who crossed the border and are being shipped to New York,” she posted. “When I asked a Delta representative if this was the case, his response was, ‘What does it matter, they’re humans too.’ What is happening???? Are taxpayer dollars paying for this????”</p><p>However, there was no way to verify St. Clair’s claim that most of the passengers on her flight were migrants. Even if they were migrants, they were not in the country illegally. After all, they would have been processed and have submitted an asylum request.</p><p><a href=#><strong>POLL—Should the U.S. Government Create a Path to Citizenship for Undocumented Immigrants?</strong></a></p><p>“I had a dozen other passengers come up & thank me for asking about our Delta flight full of migrants who illegally entered our country,” St. Clair wrote. “I’m sick and tired of being told wanting a secure border is ‘racist.'” She seemed even more displeased, saying, “Migrants are being flown Delta premium cabin, given phones, and housing while Americans struggle to afford groceries and rent.”</p><p>Furthermore, St. Clair mentioned that one of the alleged migrants was right next to her in the premium cabin and questioned if they had gone through medical screening. However, some people on X didn’t support her sentiment, while others did.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ:</strong><a href=#><strong> Elon Musk Prepared to Go to Prison if U.S. Government Censors X</strong></a></p><p>“Well, maybe if you had decided not to pay for the bombs that were dropped on these migrant’s countries and rob them off of eventual development and basic infrastructure, seating next to you, that too on a Delta would be their last choice. Stand up at the root of aggression,” one person wrote.</p><p>“Delta is just like our crooked & evil government. Putting illegals before paying customers like the government puts illegals before our own people who are out literally sleeping on sidewalks. This country is turning into a third-world country right before our eyes. Infuriating,” another X user wrote.</p><p><strong>You Might Also Like This</strong></p><p><a href=#>Panic as Experts Say a New COVID Variant Is Dominating the US</a></p><p><a href=#>Jury Finds Tacoma Police Officers Not Guilty of 2020 Death of Black Man in Police Custody</a></p><p><a href=#>“We Can Still Stop It” Mercieca Calls on Americans to Halt an ‘Autocratic Takeover’ of The U.S</a></p><p><a href=#>Stefanik Fumes as US Census Data Shows New York Lost the Most Residents in 2023</a></p><p><a href=#>Lincoln Memorial Temporarily Closed as Unknown Suspects Deface Monument with “Free Gaza” Graffiti</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ksq27zWakrqubYrCiuMusZKitpGKxprjTmmSaoaJiuaq6xKxkmqWZmXqiuMuenp6cXaK2qL7Ap6tmq5ievbG1zaBkrJuRo7GiuI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
