It’s also a chance for fans to feel up close and personal with their favorite <a href=#>movie</a> or TV stars. But sometimes, it doesn’t exactly go to plan. That’s what happened with Orlando Bloom, who shared his ink with fellow social media users. The tattoo had a special meaning close to his heart, but it turns out it spelled his son’s name incorrectly.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-orlando-bloom-proudly-showed-off-his-tattoo-before-realization-kicked-in>Orlando Bloom proudly showed off his tattoo before realization kicked in</h2><p>Taking to his <a href=#>Instagram</a>, the Pirates of the Caribbean actor shared a black-and-white image of himself grinning for the camera. He proudly showed off his arm, which appeared to have a line of numbers and dots (Morse code) tattooed on it. He captioned the snap: “new&nbsp;#tattoo&nbsp;can you guess who?”</p><p>Fans rushed to the comments to place their guesses on just what it meant.</p><p>One fan wrote: “Aww I’m guessing your son name date weight and time of birth…”</p><p>Another said: “Ooouuuu I think I figured it out.. The numbers are the birthdates of your son and the new baby that will be born “6/1/20” Loveeeeeee it!!”</p><p>They gushed over the unique way for the star to honor his baby boy. But that was before some eagle-eyed viewers noticed something was up.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-thought-his-ink-paid-tribute-to-his-dog>Fans thought his ink paid tribute to his dog</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1169471756-1024x700.jpg><p>However, despite some guessing what it meant, others suggested that the tattoo was inked wrong.</p><p>One person penned: “I think it’s your dog- but is that the correct coding?”</p><p>A second said: “The date of birth is also misspelled is 06012011.”</p><p>Some suggested that it wasn’t the date that was the issues, but rather it was his son’s name, Flynn, which was spelled out as “Frynn.”</p><p>“Just squeeze another ‘dot’ in there to make it an ‘L’ (‘L’ is • – •• whereas tattoo reads • – • which is an ‘R’) unless it’s supposed to be Frynn,” said one concerned Instagram user, while another wrote: “FRYNN” with a number of rolling on the floor laughing emojis.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-tattoo-gets-corrected>The tattoo gets corrected</h2><p>Luckily, the design of the ink meant he didn’t have to have a huge correction. Orlando was able to fix it pretty quickly.</p><p>Sharing a photo of himself holding up his arm again with a smile, the 46-year-old said: “••-••-••-•—•-• finally dot it right! How do you make a mistake like that?&nbsp;#pinterestfail&nbsp;(read the small print) 😂 fortunately I know how to spell Sidi. Forever my boy” and added a red heart emoji.</p><p>The <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star has two children. A son with his ex-wife, Australian supermodel Miranda Kerr. He was born in 2011, two years before the pair divorced.</p><p>He also has a daughter Daisy with <a href=#>Katy Perry</a>, who he has had an on-again, off-again relationship with. But, the Lord of the Rings star dropped on one knee to ask the big question in 2019. And they’ve been in love ever since. She announced she was pregnant in 2020 during the music video for her song Never Worn White.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2aEcLvRpZinnJ9ir627zqZksJmjYrOwvsKem2asn2KzqsSMoaCsZaSWwbW7zmamn2WYnsBuv86nqmamkaKybq3FrZyrZZenrrexjKagrKyRoLJw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
