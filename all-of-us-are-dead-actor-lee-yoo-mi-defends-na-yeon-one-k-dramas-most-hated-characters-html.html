Her desire to live was just expressed in a different way. Na-yeon does what she can because she’s human. That’s why I think people feel pity [for her]. If she’s really mean, that means I acted well, right?”</p><p id=par-10_51>Actor Yoo Chan-young chimed in, saying, “Although Na-yeon’s personality is a bit off, she doesn’t say anything that isn’t true. In real life, you need someone like that.” Lee explains when dissecting the All of Us Are Dead character further, Na-yeon is someone who is “faithful to the emotions she feels.”</p><p id=par-11_50>Audiences came to dislike the Na-yeon from the start, but by episode 8, she realizes her mistakes and how lonely she is.
