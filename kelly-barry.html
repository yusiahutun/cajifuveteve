He entered the show on 15th February 2023 and since then, he has made up to eight games, with a total winning amount of $184,881. Stephen Webb is surely making his path toward the Next Tournament of Championship but as it is said, it feels “not to be okay” to lose after a long winning streak. Whatever it is, we will surely miss the stamina he showed on the stage and maintained his position. Hopefully, we will get new to see the next season.</p><p>What we are here to talk about is the champion who dethroned the eight-game winner, Stephen Webb. It is none other than a lady boss and a marketing communication specialist, Kelly Barry. Kelly entered the show on 17th March 2023 and stood against Stephen Webb and Mark Bernstein. On the very first day, she had a winning of $14,600.</p><h3><strong>Early Life</strong></h3><p>Kelly Barry (aged 53 – 57) seems to be brought up and nurtured in the United States only. She went to the University of California, Berkeley (1990 – 1992), the University of Washington (1995 – 1998), and South Seattle College (2009 – 2011) she is skilled in technical writing, product management, Research and Development, Applications Engineering, and many other skills related to marketing.</p><h3><strong>Kelly Barry Career</strong></h3><p>Kelly began her career in the position of Application Engineer at Park Scientific Instruments. She stretched her working profile from 1993 to 1995 (or two years). From 1998 to 2000, she worked as a Product Marketing Manager for KLA-Tencor. There at the company, she was hired as a Product Team Leader, handling product pricing and positioning, and product development.</p><p>From 2001 to 2005, she worked for Timbre Technologies (a subsidiary of Tokyo Electron), handling staff applications. At the same time, she worked as a Staff Technical Marketing member at Tokyo Electron. Again, from 2001 to 2005, she worked as an Applications Manager for Timbre Technologies / TEL.</p><p>From 2007 to 2010, she worked as a sommelier for Seattle Cellars, handling retail sales, e-mail communications and a lot related to marketing. She worked as a product manager at Vantage Technology Corporation from May 2013 to March 2016.</p><p>She had other various professional experiences at Cooper-Garrod Estate Vineyards and Brian Carter Cellars. Presently, she is working for Barry Consulting Group and KLA as a consultant and Marketing Communications Specialist, respectively.</p><h4><strong>Jeopardy&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>On one hand, Stephen Webb lost his month-long and eight games winning streak. He bagged the total amount of $184K back to his home and posted on Reddit that he “hit a wall”. He said that he was happy for his victor Kelly Barry. While going towards the final Jeopardy, Stephen had a total amount of $12,600 whereas Kelly had $11,600 and Mark $4,000, on last Friday’s episode (17th March 2023).</p><p>During the round of Final Jeopardy, Kelly answered the correct one. She added $3,000 to beat the streak with $14,600 as his total winning of the day. She was happy to be declared the new champion on the stage. On the other hand, Stephen had to see a drop to $1,999 with a shaking hand but he graciously clapped for the winner. Later, it was announced that he will return for the 2023 Tournament of Champions. The interesting fact about the 2023 Tournament of Champions is that the event is going to face only male contestants.</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Kelly Barry Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Kelly Barry</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>1960s</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2023)</td><td>60s</td></tr><tr><td>Residence</td><td>Seattle, Washington, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Marketing Communications Specialist</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>University of California, Berkeley</td></tr><tr><td>Qualification</td><td>Graduate</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Married</td></tr><tr><td>Who is her husband?</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>–</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><strong>Personal Life</strong></h3><p>As of now, there is no information on Kelly’s marriage.
