Tel: 2895 5000
Open: Monday-Friday 6pm-10.45pm; Saturday and Sunday noon-3pm, 5pm-10.45pm
Cuisine: Japanese tabletop barbecue Price: about HK$350 without drinks and the service charge.
Ambience: very casual. Diners sit on wooden backless stools at square tables in the small, open-front restaurant. Each table has a gas grill on which the servers cook many of the orders. Pros: the shellfish dishes were very fresh. Cons: as with yakitori and kushiyaki, the food here is meant to go with alcohol (although we saw very few people drinking it)."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

So it's seasoned accordingly. Some of the food was very salty for those of us only drinking tea. Ordering can be confusing because it's not clear about the size of each dish: some will feed only one person, while others will suffice for several. The live turban shell (HK$68 each), barbecued in the shell, was unpleasantly bitter, while the dried sardines (HK$38 for four) were too salty and intense on their own and probably should be eaten with rice. Atka mackerel (HK$92 for a large half) had the rich fattiness we expected from the fish, but its very soft texture became unpleasant after a few bites.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Recommended dishes: surf clam (HK$84 each), cooked in the shell on the grill, needed only a little soy sauce to bring out the sweetness of the flesh. The tuna cheek (HK$84) consisted of rich, tender and succulent chunks of dark-fleshed fish. Whelks (HK$45 for five pieces) had a pleasantly bouncy texture, as did the deep-fried chicken soft bones (HK$38). Our favourite dish was the crab roe (HK$72), cooked in its shell with an egg yolk, which was so rich and delicious we were tempted to order another portion. Tomato salad (HK$38) seemed plain at first - the tomatoes were juicy but not as sweet as many we've tasted - but did a good job of balancing the saltiness of the other dishes. Shellfish and spiral shell rice (HK$88) was a simple and pleasantly plain ending to the meal.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">What else? Almost the entire menu is seafood, so don't come here if you're in the mood for meat.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdpbn16fZJonaKrmJq%2Frq3NrGScrZmotq%2BxjKGYppmplriqedOaoKygnw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
