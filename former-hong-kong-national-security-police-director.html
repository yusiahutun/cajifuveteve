An internal investigation cleared him of illegal conduct, but he still faces a civil service disciplinary hearing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A man accused of being the parlour’s owner – Wu Ping-hung, 61 – was charged with keeping a vice establishment and operating an unlicensed massage parlour.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Three women who allegedly worked there – Nguyen Thi Thu Huong, 34, and masseuses Li Yiqing, 36, and Zhang Mingfang, 35 – were also hit with charges relating to managing such establishments. All four have pleaded not guilty.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The trial, which began last week, heard that an undercover officer visited the spa three times between October 2020 and March 2021 to gather evidence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/08/16/830d04ac-85fc-4d64-b84a-550707ba9ec9_1126e908.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After the undercover officer received a massage during his first two visits, he was offered a chance to purchase additional services involving bodily contact with the masseuse.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On Tuesday, Choi said he used to spend up to an hour in each of his visits, but had never been offered services of a sexual nature.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said he had received “the same service” every time he went to the parlour, and that he could not handpick a masseuse to serve him. He said he did not believe such services would be available in the first place.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Was there ever any suggestion at any of your times there, that sexual services of any kind were available?” asked barrister Oliver Davies, who represents Wu.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“No one had ever suggested that to me,” Choi replied.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Uproar in Hong Kong police over new role for scandal-hit national security chief</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In cross-examination, prosecutor Claudia Ko Hoi-yee sought to diminish the value of Choi’s evidence by highlighting that he had no knowledge or control over the anti-vice operation, nor did he have an opportunity to clarify whether the facility had a valid licence. Choi agreed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“You visited the premises in your private capacity, didn’t you? It has nothing to do with your official capacity,” Ko said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Yes,” Choi replied.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The officer added his observation was based on his personal experience and he could not tell whether any illicit activities had taken place in other parts of the spa he had never been to.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Parties will return on September 23 to submit closing submissions before Magistrate Jason Wan Siu-ming delivers his verdict.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZoo5qvXZa7pXnCq6CmnV%2BWv7W1wqWcaGthbYZxhZZonaiqnZq%2FbrTOp55mo5%2BjtG66wK2gqKaRoXq0scKuqaKsqWK9sLjInJxmnJmnsqTAzqs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
