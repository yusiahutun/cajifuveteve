Unfortunately for Nicole Richie's kids, Sparrow and Harlow, the show is now dominating their TikTok feeds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The Simple Life&nbsp;is apparently having a big moment on TikTok, so they do tell me that they watch clips on TikTok," Richie told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Variety</a> in a new interview. "Their friends watch it. I get a lot of eye rolls in my house all the time. It's right on brand with how they see me, in general."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The show, which recently celebrated its 20th anniversary in December, is not enough to get Richie's kids into acting or reality TV. "I'm not sure. I highly doubt that my son does," she said, when asked if Sparrow and Harlow have any plans to follow in her footsteps. "My daughter might but she's not banging down my door asking about it. She's really living that 16-year-old life."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the meantime, the 16 and 14-year-old are happy to join mom on the red carpet. For the premiere of Richie's latest movie, a remake of 1991's Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead, Sparrow and Harlow made their red carpet debut to support their mother, who also stars in the film.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Speaking with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>TODAY</a> about the family affairs, Richie told the hosts, "They are teens so they’re pretty chill about it. But they were happy to be there and they did tell me I did a good job. So I was like, ‘I will take that, thank you very much.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Richie also gushed about being a parent to two teens, calling it her "favorite stage" of Sparrow and Harlow's adolescence. "I just so clearly remember being 16, that it’s actually surprising how quickly I can go back there," she shared. "When my daughter’s telling me drama with her friends, I go, ‘I remember. Laila Heckmath did that to me,’ I remember first and last names, so it’s fun. It’s wild. And just the best."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zaKaqKSVYr%2Bqr8einGajmZnAbr%2FPmqmrp6ditaK%2By6iuZq%2BRqbCptc2gZK2glWLAqrnPpZxmpJmbsm6ElWtwcm5g</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
