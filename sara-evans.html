She was critically hailed as a neo-traditionalist with the release of her debut album, 'Three Chords and the Truth,' in 1997, but it wasn't until her second album's title song, "No Place That Far," reached No. 1 in 1999 that she scored her commercial breakthrough. As Evans gradually moved her sound more to commercial country, her third album, 'Born to Fly,' scored another No. 1 hit with its title song in 2001 and was certified Double Platinum, and Evans was the most-nominated artist at the CMA Awards that year, winning Video of the Year. She's gone on to a long string of hits including "Suds in the Bucket," "A Real Fine Place to Start" and "A Little Bit Stronger," and was the first country star to appear on 'Dancing With the Stars' in 2006. Evans married former University of Alabama quarterback Jay Barker in 2008.</p><ul><li><span><strong>Full Name:</strong> Sara Lynn Evans</span></li><li><span><strong>Birth Date:</strong> Feb. 5, 1971</span></li><li><span><strong>Top Songs:</strong> “Suds in the Bucket,” “Born to Fly,” “I Could Not Ask for More”</span></li><li><span><strong>Did You Know?</strong> Evans was hit by a car at age 8, fracturing both legs</span></li><li><span><strong>Further Reading:</strong> <a href=#>Top 10 Sara Evans Songs</a></span></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmrZmXqHy0rdGaZJ6ukaPAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
