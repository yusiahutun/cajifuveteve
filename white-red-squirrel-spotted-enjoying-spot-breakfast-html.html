This one was spotted having breakfast in a garden.
It is actually a red squirrel, but suffers from leucism, a rare genetic condition similar to albinism but not causing the pink eyes found in albinos.

One in 100,000 creatures sport white fur due to lack of melanin</a></h3><p class=mol-para-with-font>Albinism, a genetic condition which reduces the amount of melanin a creature has, can dramatically reduce an animal's chance of survival in the wild for a number of reasons.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The condition leaves animals with white skin or fur because of a lack of pigment. This is particularly problematic for creatures such as squirrels who need to blend in with tree trunks and leaves to avoid predators.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Another problem faced by creatures with albinism is poor eyesight. The signature pink or reddish eyes albinos have have usually developed abnormally, and so they often struggle with depth perception and focussing on objects.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The increased difficulty in surviving on top of the fact that albinism occurs in just 1 in 100,000 mammal births means that albino squirrels are incredibly rare.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However, it is important to draw a distinction between albino squirrels and the far rarer white squirrel.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>White squirrels suffer from leucism, a mutated gene which turns their skin white but leaves their eyes black, meaning they do not suffer with any of the eye problems albinos have.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>There are around five million grey squirrels in Britain, but experts believe there are fewer than one in a million that have leucism.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWKFc4WYam5yZ4edtrWxjKucnWWjpsKqvtGeo2aroKTBtbHDZpynop%2Butq%2BzjKynqKxdl7%2BmrcqfmKysXp3Brrg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
