I was like, ‘How can I now treat myself better? I think a lot of people when a breakup happens, we think it’s our fault. We think we could have done things better. We could have done this. And for me it was like, ‘OK, the universe wants me to focus on myself,’ and I can totally do that.”</p><h2>Lily Collins (2019)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Lily-Collins.jpg><p>Though their romance was never confirmed, rumors circulated in 2019 that Centineo and Collins were in a secret romance.
