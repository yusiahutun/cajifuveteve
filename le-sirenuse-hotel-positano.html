At that point, the American author was at the height of his fame – East of Eden had been published the previous year, and The Grapes of Wrath was already part of the literary canon – and so his widely read article in Bazaar drew immediate attention to this small town on the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/travel/g38035543/amalfi-coast-hotels/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Amalfi Coast" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Amalfi Coast</a>. Yet for the reasons that Steinbeck himself identified at the time, Positano has remained as appealing as it was when he first visited, protected by its extraordinary position on the precipitous hillsides above the bay, where there is no space to build tourist resorts, car parks or new roads.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">‘Positano bites deep,’ observed Steinbeck in Bazaar. ‘It is a dream place that isn’t quite real when you are there and becomes beckoningly real after you have gone. Its houses climb a hill so steep it would be a cliff except that stairs are cut in it... The small curving bay of unbelievably blue and green water lips gently on a beach of small pebbles. There is only one narrow street and it does not come down to the water. Everything else is stairs, some of them as steep as ladders. You do not walk to visit a friend, you either climb or slide.’ This description still holds true today; and the hotel where Steinbeck stayed, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.booking.com/hotel/it/le-sirenuse.en-gb.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Le Sirenuse" data-vars-ga-product-id=26031624-b8b7-45d2-ba4d-fbbc1801ef86 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.booking.com/hotel/it/le-sirenuse.en-gb.html data-product-url=https://www.booking.com/hotel/it/le-sirenuse.en-gb.html data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Fhotel%2Fit%2Fle-sirenuse.en-gb.html" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand="king oscar" data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=05aaf057-e727-4caa-815d-1bc02f09d131 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="king oscar" class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Le Sirenuse</a>, remains at the heart of Positano, as alluring as its name suggests. In every bedroom, there is an elegantly bound copy of Steinbeck’s essay, along with another small book, entitled A Journey to Positano, its pages blank, inviting each guest to write their own story. Much is unchanged since Steinbeck’s day, when he and his wife were enchanted by ‘an old family house converted into a first class hotel, spotless and cool, with grape arbors over its outside dining rooms. Every room has its own little balcony and looks out over the blue sea to the islands of the sirens from which those ladies sang so sweetly.’</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Now, as then, Le Sirenuse is owned by an aristocratic Neapolitan family, the Sersales, who converted their 18th-century summer home into a hotel in 1951. When Steinbeck visited, it was supervised by Marchese Paolo Sersale, at that time the mayor of Positano, and a connoisseur of antiques and paintings, whose collection of heirlooms continues to give the hotel its remarkable charm and character. Since then, Paolo’s nephew, Antonio Sersale, has taken over from his father Franco, who died in January this year. Franco’s photographs of his journeys around the world – to Ethiopia, Papua New Guinea, Tibet and Afghanistan – add another element of interest to the distinguished family portraits that hang on the walls (one of the venerable Sersale ancestors was a cardinal; another a sea-faring nobleman of the 16th century). Meanwhile, Antonio and his wife Carla (who is also responsible for the hotel’s stylish boutique) are adding to the eclectic collection with contemporary pieces, including a new work by the Turner Prize-winning artist Martin Creed that will be installed later this year.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The overall effect is beguiling, as though one were staying with remarkably hospitable friends with exquisite good taste, supremely high standards of housekeeping, excellent staff and a Michelin-starred chef. The guest rooms are beautifully decorated with antique furniture and original pictures; the modernised bathrooms are luxurious and the beds wonderfully comfortable, made up with fresh white linen. Indeed, such is the pleasure to be had sitting on a balcony outside one’s bedroom, admiring the view over the rooftops of Positano, or lounging beside the pool, lulled by the scent of lemon trees, roses and bougainvillea, that it is tempting not to stray beyond Le Sirenuse. But that would be a pity, for Positano is a place that calls to be explored on foot, and with enough time to enjoy getting lost within its labyrinthine maze of pathways.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">True, all the steps seem to lead down to the same destination – the beach and harbour, where boats will take you to Capri, passing the archipelago of tiny islands known as Li Galli or Le Sirenuse, after the mythical sirens who were said to reside there. But the stone steps that circle upwards into the mountains are equally enthralling, leading to a trail known as the Path of the Gods. A steep flight of stairs, just across the road from the hotel, takes you to a small, whitewashed chapel, surrounded by the town’s peaceful cemetery, where dozens of graves are arrayed in stone terraces overlooking the sea. If you choose, as I did, to continue climbing upwards, the path leads past a series of walled gardens filled with citrus blossom and lovingly tended vegetable patches. Hundreds of steps onwards, the village houses give way to olive groves, planted on the precipitous hillsides; and every time I thought I’d reached the summit, yet another flight of steps would appear. An hour later, I was still climbing, and the air was sweet and cool, high in the mountains above Positano.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I encountered only one other person on this long walk – a local man, carrying a wooden pallet of lettuces from his garden – and he smiled and nodded, but did not stop his swift descent down towards the town. Such was the dream-like sense of timelessness, the clouds wreathing the mountain peaks above me, the blue sea below, unmarked by any sign of modernity, that I half expected to see the shadow of a Roman god – Bacchus or Mercury, perhaps – disappearing just out of sight, into the shade of ancient oaks and fig-trees. But instead, there were only the tiny, darting lizards, and white butterflies, always ahead of me, fluttering in a gentle breeze.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Each time I stopped to catch my breath, there was another impressive panorama to admire; and a faint otherworldliness, as the light shimmered between the sky and the ocean. If a faint echo of a siren’s song had drifted upwards from the islands below, I wouldn’t have been entirely surprised; instead, there was the gentle call of chiming church bells in Positano, and the promise of a long, cold drink on a peaceful terrace at Le Sirenuse...<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.booking.com/hotel/it/le-sirenuse.en-gb.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Le Sirenuse, from £680 per room per night" data-vars-ga-product-id=26031624-b8b7-45d2-ba4d-fbbc1801ef86 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.booking.com/hotel/it/le-sirenuse.en-gb.html data-product-url=https://www.booking.com/hotel/it/le-sirenuse.en-gb.html data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Fhotel%2Fit%2Fle-sirenuse.en-gb.html" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand="king oscar" data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=05aaf057-e727-4caa-815d-1bc02f09d131 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="king oscar" class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Le Sirenuse, from £680 per room per night</a>.<br></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwwNGarZ6kX528tbHLZqmerpmaxLR7zZ6urGeRaIF6fJdoo55lo56%2FprrUrJxmoJ%2Bpsq15z6iqoqyRo7xw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
