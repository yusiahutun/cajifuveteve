Four for the season, including last week’s crucial winner against Fulham is almost as remarkable a tally as his single yellow card.
Almost! Bowyer knows better than anyone that it will take more than a low-profile lifestyle and fatherhood to convince some of his critics that he has changed."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Bowyer knows better than anyone that it will take more than a low-profile lifestyle and fatherhood to convince some of his critics that he has changed.</p><p>Eight-month-old twins Charlie and Amelie are keeping his hands full and when he can he is happy to swap the baby powder for a rod and just go and lose himself by a river.</p><p>Bowyer is a mad-keen fisherman and can proudly boast to have taken delivery of a 54lb carp. The 32-year-old East Ender whiling away the hours quietly in the open air is something some would find hard to picture.</p><p>In fairness, his life has read like something straight out of an Albert Square script at times, but Bowyer insists his life off the pitch has been quiet for some time.</p><p>Scrapping with team-mates, court cases and numerous indiscretions did combine to give Bowyer the fiercest reputation in football.</p><p>Now the former Leeds, Newcastle and West Ham star is a big fish in Brum and reveals that last summer he quite literally got away from it all with an idyllic fishing break in France. Bowyer said: “I went to France for one week, came back for two weeks and then went again for a week.</p><p>“It was just to do nothing but fish for a couple of weeks.</p><p>“I’ve been doing it for around 10-12 years now and I catch big fish. It’s a decent standard.</p><p>“I love carp fishing and the biggest I have caught is 54lbs. It’s just something I enjoy.”</p><p>So complete was his escape-from-it-all break that he admits he completely lost track of what was happening in the world of football.</p><p>“To be honest, I don’t really take any notice of the summer dealings. The only move I knew about was Cristiano Ronaldo’s and only because that was on the news.</p><p>“That’s why you have a break – to get away from it all. Otherwise it would be just like work all year. The only time I took a call was from my agent and we spoke about it here at Birmingham.”</p><p>Back at home he has been keeping busy as the twins make sure he doesn’t find himself with nothing to do.</p><p>Bowyer added: “I’m doing stuff that I have never done before. I didn’t realise it would be so hard.</p><p>“I am more tired than I’ve ever been. Do I commiserate with Wayne Rooney?</p><p>“Well, he has only got one, whereas in my house one wakes the other and it is like a conveyor belt.”</p><p>Next-up it is Wolves in the big Midlands derby tomorrow, but games just can’t come around quickly enough for Bowyer.</p><p>“I just like playing and enjoying my football. Days like these make waking up on a Sunday morning worthwhile,” he said.</p><p>Brum boss Alex McLeish said: “When Lee arrived his wife was expecting the twins and I said to him: ‘Look, you are a grown man now.’</p><p>“We do see the red mist occasionally in training but we remind him and he puts the brakes on.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e8Wopq2akaG5cK7Iq6Sippedrq55wqKrsmWcmrJurs6wsJ6qXZq7q7vYoqWgZWFtfnN9km1p</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
