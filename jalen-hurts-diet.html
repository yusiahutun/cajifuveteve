He was drafted into the <a href=# id=auto-tag_nfl data-tag=nfl>NFL</a> as the 53rd pick in round two of the 2020 draft. He made his debut in December of that year after veteran QB Carson Wentz’s performance began to deteriorate. Hurts also thrived during his college football career, throwing over 2,780 yards and 23 touchdowns in his freshman year at the University of Alabama Crimson Tide.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/jason-kelce-retire.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/lombardi-trophy.jpg><p>So what is Jalen Hurt’s diet?

The Philadelphia Eagles <a href=# rel=noopener>quarterback</a> has an extremely healthy diet that consists of no sugary drinks and eating greens all the time. When asked about his weight during the offseason at a press conference in the summer of 2022, Hurts said, “I’m not necessarily lighter. I’m the same weight, about 220. Consistently 220 throughout my days. I just basically feel cleaner in terms of drinking water and laying off the sugary drinks.” He added that he loves lemonade and found an alternative drink Lemon Perfect that has less calories but has tons of flavors and still works for him. “Just changing things that I put in my body. I think it’s really helped as far as my conditioning,” he said. “How I feel when I wake up. Eating my greens, eating a lot of protein, and drinking a lot of water so I think it’s very beneficial.”</p><p>Though he eats lots of healthy food, Hurts confessed that he loves to put hot sauce on everything. In an interview with GQ on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">10 Things He Can’t Live Without,</a> he pulls out a bottle of Louisiana Hot Sauce. “One of my big essentials, my hot sauce. Being where I’m from, I mean, we put this on everything. If it’s missing a little piece just put a little Louisiana on there. Not to Tabasco, not nothing else, I need Louisiana’s. One of my essentials would’ve been Popeye’s and it is an essential. I grew up eating a two-piece Tuesday special. Every Tuesday, you could get two pieces of chicken, a drum and a thigh for 99 cent. Brings back so many childhood memories. I’m taking things to the next level, in terms of my diet. I don’t eat it as much, but every blue moon. I gotta get me a two piece or a three piece with a red bean, apple pie, grape jelly, lemonade, all that. But for now I just throw the hot sauce on whatever I can, try and keep it simple. He also shouts out Lemon Perfect again as he says, “You know, I talked about how I like Popeye’s and like drinking lemonade, all that. Now I got to the point where I don’t do that as much. I try and find healthier options to consume something that’s flavorful. Lemon Perfect get the job done.</p><h2>What is Jalen Hurts’ workout plan?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/jalen-hurts-.jpg><p>What is Jalen Hurts’ workout plan? Jalen Hurts has a very vigorous workout plan—one that involves him deadlifting 600 lbs. The star quarterback reportedly started powerlifting when he was 15 years old and he would go to powerlifting meets in high school.</p><p>When Hurts was <a href=# rel=noopener>playing in college</a> with Crimson Tide, Hurts squatted 450 lbs, which was 2.5 times his body weight. He also hit a max bench press of 275 lbs. “He might only be a freshman, but Jalen Hurts is one of the strongest people on the entire team,” his former school captioned a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">video</a> of him lifting.</p><p>To describe his own workout and strength, he said that “I’m still cockstrong, though,” meaning that he is self-assured. “This offseason I did something I’ve never done before, you know what I’m saying,” Hurts told reporters on June 2, 2023. “I went to Cali and I worked out there. I got some good work out there. And I talked about how I was still in the front part of my career so I’m still trying to figure out what my offseason looks like. “Where do I want to train? What does that look like? Where am I going to be? I think that that’s something over time that I’ll find on my own and as the years go on, I’ll simply kind of figure that out myself.”</p><p>Teammate Lane Johnson also marveled at Hurts’ lifting abilities. “He’s super strong,” Johnson told<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> Philadelphia’s local NBC station</a>. “His dad has been a coach his whole life, he came from a coaching background. He’s an ex-powerlifter, so he maybe could have out-deadlifted me if he wanted to but trying to hold it back for my ego’s sake.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/super-bowl-book.jpeg><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$16.59+</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>$29.95</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>45% Off</span></p><p>For more about the <a href=# id=auto-tag_super-bowl data-tag=super-bowl>Super Bowl</a>, football fans can check out <a data-pmc-sp-product=53d1db0529f18ff6311aa0fe97247319 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"When It Was Just a Game: Remembering the First Super Bowl","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"When It Was Just a Game: Remembering the First Super Bowl","price":"24.87","id":"1589799208","category":"State & Local"},"id":1355978,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>When It Was Just a Game: Remembering the First Super Bowl</a> by Harvey Frommer. The best-selling book delves into the history of the first Super Bowl, which was originally known as the AFL-NFL Championship Game. (The term “Super Bowl” was coined only in its third year.) The debut game, between the winning Green Bay Packers and the Kansas City Chiefs, was played in front of only 61,946 people at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum—an audience well below the stadium’s capacity. Harvey Frommer, a sports historian and reporter, puts the tale of that momentous game together using oral history, gathered from hundreds of interviews with players, coaches, media and spectators alike.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
