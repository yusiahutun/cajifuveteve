Rather, the dry pedicure trend focuses on the professional salon service — namely, the traditional step of soaking your feet in a tub of warm water. As its name implies, water is now nowhere to be found, and that's a good thing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To be clear, not only are dry manicures and pedicures not that different from their conventional counterparts, but they also aren't entirely new. For a complete breakdown of this viral nail trend, we turned to the experts to share everything you need to know before your next pedicure appointment.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-a-dry-pedicure></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is a Dry Pedicure?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A dry manicure and dry pedicure are exactly what they sound like: nail treatments that do not use water. "Dry manicures include everything you would find during your typical service — massages, cuticle trimming, buffing, et cetera — just without the use of water," says Rachel Apfel Glass, founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>GLOSSLAB</a>, which uses dry pedicures.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Instead of spending time on a soak — which can incidentally tack on extra time for the service, "the nail technician focuses on prepping and shaping the nails using specialized tools and techniques," says Mazz Hanna, nail artist and CEO of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Nailing Hollywood</a>. "It depends on the manicurist, but many use electric files for dry manicures."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Expect your technician to shape your nails using a file to get you your desired nail shape and length before gently pushing or trimming your cuticles to ensure a clean nail bed, says Hanna. (Some dry manicures may also use a cuticle softener). Then, they'll apply polish before sealing it with a topcoat.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-benefits-of-dry-pedicures></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Benefits of Dry Pedicures</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dry manicures and pedicures are often considered to be safer and more sanitary than sharing a tub of water, even if sanitized, between clients, says Glass. And because you're avoiding prolonged exposure to water, the risk of bacterial or fungal infections is reduced.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Finally, dry manicures and pedicures can also help maintain the natural moisture balance in nails, which then prevents excessive drying and weakening, Hanna says; because of that, your polish may last longer without chips, and there's minimal risk of cuticles peeling or lifting in the following days.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-drawbacks-of-dry-pedicures></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Drawbacks of Dry Pedicures</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hanna says that one of the downsides to a dry manicure or pedicure is that it may not provide the same level of relaxation as a traditional treatment. On top of that, "soaking nails in water can help soften the cuticles and skin," she explains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, "if you have extremely dry or damaged nails, the absence of water may limit the hydration benefits you would receive from a traditional manicure," she says. But ultimately, there's no real harm in going for a dry pedicures — and the benefits largely outweigh the risks.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-much-a-dry-pedicure-costs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Much a Dry Pedicure Costs</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The cost for a dry manicure should cost about the same as treatment with water, according to Glass, which can vary depending on the location, salon, and nail technician.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In general, you can expect to pay anywhere between $50 to $150 for a dry pedicure. Hanna suggests contacting local nail salons or checking their websites for pricing information specific to your area.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-where-to-get-a-dry-pedicure></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Where to Get a Dry Pedicure</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Dry manicures are gaining popularity, and many nail salons now offer this service," says Hanna. GLOSSLAB, for example, offers water-free manicures and pedicures at all 20 of their studios throughout the U.S.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Also, some salons may call dry manicures "polish changes" or "express manicures," which might change the price, says Glass — so be sure to ask your nail technician at your next appointment.
