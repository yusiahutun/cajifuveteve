But because my parents taught me that God is going to send you obstacles and you have to overcome them, it put me at ease. It's very interesting, the times I've felt that I can't breathe emotionally, and I react to things in a very impulsive manner – where it's anger or crying. And being able to speak to somebody about that was kind of a revelation that it was okay for me to feel depressed.”</p><p>She continued- <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-603 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“I remember having to find somebody to stay with my daughter because I didn't want to stop school, and I couldn't stop working. It was raining, and I was like, "Who can I trust that is not my mom?" I realized you have to put your armour on; you have to become a warrior, because family is not there.”</p><p>Polanco then conceived a son named Aryam. Polanco says that her two kids have two different fathers.&nbsp;In an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview </a>with Cosmopolitan Magazine in June 2015, she explained-</p><p>"I used to feel self-conscious about the fact that my kids have two different fathers. Being a statistic was something that was so negative to me. But now I'm like, 'Hey, listen, it is what it is. It didn't work out the first time; it didn't work out the second time. I have two kids who have two different baby fathers.'"</p><p>Polanco and her son’s father were engaged for around six years and ended their engaged&nbsp;relationship around two years ago.
