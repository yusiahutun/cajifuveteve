Members of a K-pop band <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">usually live together in a dormitory</span></a> to foster teamwork, but that is not an option for a coed act.”<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Critic Jung Min-jae agreed, adding that these aforementioned elements make it riskier for the labels to produce a group that includes both men and women. Jung also touched on another conundrum they face when devising strategies to promote their singers.</p><p>“The companies should decide which gender of fans to target, but the answer may not be easy to find,” he said. “Although mixed-gender groups can showcase different kinds of charm that make them stand out, they are unlikely to rise to stardom without having a specific target audience.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/08/19/ac6c94a0-3778-46b7-9cd2-d17f84c1910e_d7491f3d.jpg>Last summer, the one-off mixed gender group SSAK3, which was formed on MBC’s reality show Hangout with Yoo, sat atop multiple music streaming charts with its retro-tinged hit, Summer Sea Again. The success story of SSAK3 – comprising of comedian and the program’s host Yoo Jae-suk, singer Lee Hyori and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">singer-actor Rain</span></a> – led a plethora of people to think that such groups might once again spring up to take over the music industry.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Would-be Olympians? 5 Korean stars who trained to be athletes first</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Critic Jung, however, says SSAK3 was merely an “exceptional case”. “The success of SSAK3 did not imply the revival of mixed-gender groups,” he remarked. “It was a project group created through a popular variety show. The programme featured the entire process of its debut and widely promoted its song. The power of a TV show – not the power of music – made it almost impossible for SSAK3 to be unsuccessful.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jung also referred to Koyote – a vocal group made up of Kim Jong-min, Shin Ji and Bbaek Ga, which debuted in 1998 – to elaborate on his point. “Koyote also put out a new single titled Oh My Summer last summer, but it hardly received any attention. Given this fact, I think that SSAK3’s victory has little to do with the revival of mixed-gender acts.”</p><p>Both Jung and Seo believe that the status quo of the groups will be maintained in the K-pop world at least for a while.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/08/19/39edf120-49ca-4af8-ae69-888f03396d1f_a464b7f9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“K-pop record labels are not quite motivated yet to launch mixed-gender groups, because they have not witnessed many successful cases recently,” Seo noted. “As of now, there are no other conspicuous groups except for Kard. To make it worse, the protracted Covid-19 pandemic is dealing a critical blow to many companies, deterring them from taking on fresh challenges.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">4 K-pop idols paving the way by coming out as LGBTQ+</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jung said, “K-pop acts are distinctive from indie bands or hip-hop groups [in that they put greater emphasis on their fan bases]. Coed groups may be able to ride high in the future if they focus on releasing easy-listening songs for the general public, but if they want to become K-pop idol groups, there might be some hurdles.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZpqqpJ6wrbGObGhtbWZrf3DDzq6jnWWppMJuv9OapWaapKh6sL6Mm6Oam5ultq%2B3jKKdZqyYmsZuw8SrnGalma2ypXnGnqWdnaJiwLStymxksKCp</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
