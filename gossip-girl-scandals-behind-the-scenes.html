While Jenny’s innocence was always going to end up being compromised by her social-climbing tendencies, Momsen’s off-screen punk rock transformation and work with her band, the Pretty Reckless, took things a little further than the writers had planned.

We were looking for a girl who was on the brink of becoming a woman—I don't think we saw that goth side yet [because] she was still really young; she was maybe, like, 13 when we cast her. Again, I don't think anyone had met her in person and everything was fine as far as I knew, and then it kind of took a turn.” Sure.

We didn’t understand what was happening, because everything was getting leaked, every detail… A teenager, I think either [from] Russia or Bulgaria, had hacked one of the writer’s e-mails, and was selling scripts on eBay. But they were underage, so they couldn’t be prosecuted. It was a fucking production nightmare. We would have to ‘X’ out every script.
