"He and I had some kind of weird connection," she told her costars, saying Jamie "was the first person that I did more than kiss."</p><p>In a confessional, Stoffer laid it out a little more, explaining that it all went down when they were filming "The Extreme Challenge" together back in 2000, shortly after filming wrapped on their original season of "The Real World."</p><p>"'The Extreme Challenge' was just this environment of freedom and competition and adventure and Jamie and I are both competitive, we both love adrenaline and it was gonna happen," Julie explained. "There was no way to fight it ... there was a night in a hotel room ... so, yeah, I hooked up with Jamie and it was really good."</p><p>Julie -- who was a Mormon virgin during her time on the OG season -- added, "I don't know if that's to Jamie's credit, but it just opened a door to a different part of my life and myself that I wasn't tapped into at all."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:2d2307fe-5b37-47e8-8be1-1ef574420bd3 data-container-ref=toofab:article:71ec2787-de85-4879-8ed4-e4ed5cba33bb data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/67/5by4/2022/05/10/67420e3b2d5d4ad7b810b0c42bfcd311_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Paramount+</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Real World's Julie Called Out for 'Dangerous White Woman S---' During Hard Conversations on Race</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Jamie, however, didn't share Julie's vivid memory.</p><p>"I don't remember if we were hooking up on that Challenge," he told the group -- before Stoffer defended him by saying, "I'm gonna remember it more than he's gonna remember it because it was probably a bigger deal for me, right?"</p><p>"It was kind of like this purity culture I had been in and I didn't understand my body," she said, before turning to her religious, straight edge roomie Matt Smith. "You and I were in the same position, we'd only ever kissed people and sexuality wasn't something you wanted to explore but it was something I wanted to explore. But I didn't want it to have to be romantic."</p><p>As the conversation continued, Kelley could feel something was slightly off in the room.</p><p>"I notice that Jamie is not sharing as much information as Julie is sharing," she said in a confessional. "I'm hoping, since they clearly know each other a little bit, that they've discussed this and this is okay with all the parties. Meaning, the families. These are all married people, we should all respect somebody's privacy."</p><p>Stoffer went on to say that she really needed "some kind of friends with benefits or f--- buddy" at the time, because she was "stuck in a mindset where I wasn't even free to kiss a boy" thanks to her upbringing. "I'm just really grateful that I was able to have this experience with you," she said to Jamie, "because if that hadn't of happened, I don't know what my dating life would have looked like and I don't know if I would have figured out I was sexually compatible with the man that I married."</p><p>Jamie and Julie had their own private conversation after, where he still seemed a little uncomfortable to dive into it any deeper than nodding his head and agreeing with whatever she was saying.</p><p>"It was a total mindf--- when we started messing around," she told him, saying that at the time she hated herself for liking what they did. "You gave me my first orgasm, okay, so after that I needed to feel that way, so I started masturbating and that's like a huge no-no in the Mormon church, but it was really healthy for me and really empowering."</p><p>"It's something that like was a part of my experience that I think really benefitted my life," she said, acknowledging that it's awkward to talk about.</p><p>"I had no idea that moment meant a lot to her," Jamie said in a confessional. "To me, it was evident 22 years ago that she was someone who was running hot. I think with her, there was so much wrapped up in the Mormonism and the guilt, someone needed to help her out. It's almost good it happened between us because it was not complicated by a relationship, but I didn't want her to think it was flippant or nothing because for her it meant a lot. Yeah, I probably wouldn't have done anything differently."</p><p>New episodes of "Real World Homecoming: New Orleans" drop Wednesdays on Paramount+.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a33a08ef-b3ac-429c-87c3-dc413cbc543a data-container-ref=toofab:article:71ec2787-de85-4879-8ed4-e4ed5cba33bb data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ab/5by4/2022/04/07/abd30b7481c34e3085c8a573ead883ff_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Paramount+</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Danny & Melissa Confront Julie for 'Hurtful' Behavior on Real World Homecoming New Orleans Premiere</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j25mam9fn8KttcRmqq2nlpuys3nJmqSinV2iwrO%2BwLJkoaefoMKxedGemKVlp6S%2FrbCMoaamnZOkuqq6xmalnq9dpL%2BtscCnqmadqJi5tr%2FIr5xo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
