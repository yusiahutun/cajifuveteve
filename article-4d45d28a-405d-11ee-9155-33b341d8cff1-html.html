He filled the room when he walked in. Everyone MOST definitely knew he was there. He was gonna let his presence be known. And his presence was. And is. And forevermore will be. And we are thankful.”</p><figure class="photo layout-vertical hover-expand letterbox-style-default"><span class="expand hidden-print" data-toggle=modal data-photo-target=.photo-f8cda0ec-405d-11ee-937b-0b808d009646 data-instance=#gallery-items-4d45d28a-405d-11ee-9155-33b341d8cff1-photo-modal data-target=#photo-carousel-4d45d28a-405d-11ee-9155-33b341d8cff1><span class="fas tnt-expand"></span></span> <span class=caption-text><p>Scott</p></span><span class=clearfix></span></figure><p>Letson was described as “a vibrant soul that loved the Lord and found beauty in all things, great or small,” according to her aunt Stephanie Horne, who set up a GoFundMe account to help the family with burial expenses.</p><p>Kenny Stogner, a volunteer firefighter from Sandersville, was westbound on Highway 84 on a motorcycle, desperately trying to get the attention of the pickup driver that was headed in the wrong direction. Cellphone video showed him just ahead of someone in another vehicle who filmed the crash. Powers volunteer firefighter Chasity Johnson was behind the Range Rover when the collision occurred, just after 6:30 p.m., but there was nothing that could have been done for the victims, officials said.</p><p>Both vehicles were engulfed in flames when volunteer firefighters from Glade, Powers, M&M, Sandersville and Rustin arrived, and they went to work extinguishing the burning mass of wreckage.</p><p>Deputy Coroner Don Sumrall pronounced the victims dead at the scene. EMServ Ambulance also responded along with the Jones County Sheriff’s Department, MHP and the Mississippi Department of Transportation.</p><p>No information about where the pickup got on the highway and if there had been reports about it headed in the wrong direction was available from officials before noon Monday.
