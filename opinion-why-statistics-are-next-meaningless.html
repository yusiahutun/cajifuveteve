This has arguably been the mainstream belief since the Enlightenment in the 18th century; we choose to trust scientific knowledge more than emotions and superstitious beliefs. A society that values and complies with empiricism is naturally obsessed with data, statistics and numbers – they have the most intellectual value and possess the greatest means of persuasion in every discussion.</span></span></p><p type=p><span type=span><span type=text>However, the meaningfulness of statistics has diminished to a point that it is now little more than another form of subjectivity. From having supposedly intellectual discussions, I’ve realised that there are statistics and numerical facts for everything – for every political position, every popular belief and every argument. Therefore, they don’t mean much anymore, and they certainly don’t mean enough to prove that one position is correct and another isn’t.</span></span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><a href=# class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><strong type=strong><span type=text>Hong Kong protests: Commander of city’s PLA garrison says army is ready to protect China’s sovereignty</span></strong></a></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=span><span type=text>In 2001, American professor Joel Best wrote a book called ‘Damned Lies and Statistics’. He argued that statistics can be used to prove absolutely anything. Social statistics, especially, can be manipulated and used as tools to fulfil political objectives. As a result, truth is distorted. The highest, most almighty form of truth can be distorted, according to the wielder.</span></span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=span><span type=text>In recent years, many have argued that we now live in a post-truth society, where objective facts don’t matter as much as emotions and personal beliefs. This phenomenon is observable in the political sphere. What I have further observed is that people attempt to justify and strengthen their personal beliefs by offering ‘alternative facts’ that are highly questionable and far from objective. The truth no longer matters. The creation of one’s own truth matters more.</span></span></p><span itemprop="associatedMedia image" class="BodyImage__StyledFigure-sc-19n75h5-0 eCNFdy speech-skip-target" itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><span></span></span><span type=text> </span><span type=span><span type=span><span type=span><span type=text>Injured police officers at the Legislative Council Complex in Tamar, Admiralty, during the anti-extradition bill protest on June 12.</span></span></span></span><span type=text></span><p><span type=span><span type=span><span type=span><span type=text>Photo: Nora Tam/SCMP</span></span></span></span></p><span type=text></span><span type=text></span><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=span><span type=text>The news media helps sustain our obsession with meaningless statistics. Every time we turn on the news channel, we are bombarded with numerical information that is carefully picked and chosen to present a side of the story, rather than the whole story. Rarely do we encounter the complete compilation of ‘objective facts’. Consequently, our moral judgements are developed in accordance to the narrative that we are exposed to, rather than our reaction towards the truth.</span></span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Take the recent protests in Hong Kong as an example.
