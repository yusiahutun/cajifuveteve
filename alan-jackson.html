Jackson came to Nashville after his wife approached Glen Campbell at the airport and told him about her husband, who landed a songwriting deal with Campbell's publishing company. That led to a record deal, and Jackson's 1989 debut album, 'Here in the Real World,' scored several big hits, including the title song, "Wanted" and "Chasin' That Neon Rainbow." Since then he's landed an enormous string of hits including "Livin' on Love," "Gone Country," "Drive" and many more. Jackson responded to the 9/11 attacks with a song titled "(Where Were You) When the World Stopped Turning," which many regard as an all-time classic. He has won Grammy, CMA and ACM awards, and is a member of the Grand Ole Opry and the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. In recent years he has turned his attention to gospel and bluegrass music.</p><ul><li><span><strong>Full Name:</strong> Alan Eugene Jackson</span></li><li><span><strong>Birth Date:</strong> Oct. 17, 1958</span></li><li><span><strong>Top Songs:</strong> “(Where Were You) When the World Stopped Turning,” “Chattahoochee,” “Remember When”</span></li><li><span><strong>Did You Know?</strong> Jackson used to work in the mail room at the Nashville Network</span></li><li><span><strong>Further Reading:</strong> <a href=#>Top 10 Alan Jackson Songs</a></span></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmrZmXqHyiuMCnZKOZk6DAsLqOqZignV9nfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
