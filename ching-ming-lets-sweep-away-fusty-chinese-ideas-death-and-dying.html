I lost my elder brother to heart disease in June 2021. After 10 hours of a scheduled surgery, he ended up in the intensive care unit (ICU) for 30 days, unconscious. That was a month full of anxiety, worry and fear, driving the family to the brink. The Covid-19 quarantine policy made everything more complicated."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

After 10 hours of a scheduled surgery, he ended up in the intensive care unit (ICU) for 30 days, unconscious. That was a month full of anxiety, worry and fear, driving the family to the brink. The Covid-19 quarantine policy made everything more complicated.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">We couldn’t visit. All we could do was wait at home for the hospital’s daily report. I felt like I was on a roller coaster, becoming emotional with any word from the doctors, and so did my parents. I believe they had considered the worst, but still hoped for the best.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When we were told there was no point to him receiving any more medical treatment, my parents finally broke down. My brother was 38 years old. That no parent should ever have to outlive their child is a deeply rooted idea for the Chinese. It is considered one of the greatest tragedies, a grief beyond bearing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I remember it was a sunny afternoon. We had gathered in a narrow room in a building next to the hospital, saying a last goodbye to him through a video link to the ICU. That was what the hospital could provide during the pandemic. We watched the nurses unplug him. My mother shouted his name. No one knew if he could hear it. But we hoped he could.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Asia must find the will to break the taboo on talking about death</span></p></a></h3>The biggest regret my parents and I have was that we <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">did not fully prepare</span></a> for the possibility that he might leave us forever; I wasn’t sure if he did either. The day before his surgery, he sent me the password to his bank account. I asked: why bother?<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There were no other instructions from him. We didn’t even know if he had a will or any last wishes. He deserved a better farewell, and we should have done it properly.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Once again, no one ever taught me how to do it. Sadly, death has been an absent topic in China’s systematic education. We need to be educated on the knowledge of death and be prepared for the inevitability. Three years of the pandemic have given everyone a heightened sense of the uncertainty and unpredictability of life. You never know which might come first: tomorrow or an accident.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/10/12/Draft-1-Copy-01.00_00_01_21.Still002_1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">13:57</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">In a city where many elderly die alone, Hong Kong funeral director organises respectful farewells</p><p>In a city where many elderly die alone, Hong Kong funeral director organises respectful farewells</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In December 2020, the Ministry of Education issued a statement in reply to a proposal to “strengthen life and death education for the whole society after the Covid-19 pandemic”, raised by some members of China’s advisory body. It said life and death education had been integrated into the curriculum. Some universities offer related courses. They include the practical, such as making wills, and extracurricular activities like visiting funeral homes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China’s first university course on life and death is thought to have started in 2000 at Guangzhou University. At the very beginning, few would select the course. But now it has become one of the most popular open online courses in the country. The attitude towards death seems to be changing, especially among the younger generation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to the China Will Registration Centre, wills have gained increasing acceptance in China over the past decade and those registering their wills are doing so at a younger age. From 2017-2023, the number of will registrants born in the 1980s has increased by 21.5 times; and for those born in the 1990s, by over 11.2 times. The number of those born after 2000 is also rising.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the will registration centre, there is reportedly a reminder on the screen: don’t cry. Making a will is a happy thing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/10/12/Draft-1-Copy-01.00_00_01_21.Still002_1.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It echoes the views of the ancient Chinese sages on death. Many old poems and other writings on this eternal theme considered the living as passers-by in this mortal world, and the deceased as travellers finally going home. There is no need to grieve over death, the ultimate destiny for everyone.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">People dying is as natural as the passing of the four seasons. The meaning of life lies in conforming to the natural process. That is why philosopher Zhuangzi drummed on a pot and sang after his wife had died, instead of weeping over her death.</p>Life and death are integral to each other. Only by properly facing death can we properly value life. As I learned from the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">film Coco</span></a>, death is not the end of life; forgetting is. That is in sync with the essence of the Ching Ming Festival. We celebrate it because we never forget, life continues, just in a different way. And in our remembrance, our loved ones, though dead, are always near.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Wei Wei is the former chief correspondent of the Eurasian bureau of China Central Television, based in Moscow</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kvLG1zaKmp2eTnbavrYyop6KmmaS7cK3RraCcpJVkgHOBlnFqcmeTnbavs4ymoKefXaGytb%2BMrK6enaBirrit2GadrqukrnqktMinnKydXZ6xpq3SZpuemaSdeqK6w2absqGenA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
