It was coming from ticket sales, and then to be able to reserve your own private section.”</p><p>While most of The Spire’s revenue this year has come from liquor sales, the licenses are only reviewed every two years.</p><p>“We’re as a business legally allowed to open. We’re following the rules, we’re doing everything,” Hightower added. “Sometimes people don’t know they’re putting themselves at risk. I feel like it’s our job to be the bigger person and really force their hand to keep them safe.”</p><p>The Spire was one of multiple businesses cited by TABC and inspectors reported that 59 venues across the state were discovered by inspectors to be operating outside of social distancing requirements.</p><p>Of those venues, &nbsp;52 agreed to immediately cease operations after TABC’s visit. The remaining seven businesses did not agree to suspend operations and were issued 30-day suspensions of their permit.</p><p>Venues include:</p><br><ul class=mainContentDotted><li><strong>Black Stone USA</strong>, Fredericksburg</li><li><strong>Bokeeters Cocktail Bar</strong>, New Caney</li><li><strong>Prospect Park</strong>, Houston</li><li><strong>The Park @ The Domain</strong>, Austin</li><li><strong>The Venue Private Club</strong>, Wills Point</li></ul><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ31wfJZoZ29npJrFor%2BMmqOcp5ikuaqvjJucr52ilrSmecKopKaho6i2sLqMrKysqJWjsbR5zaKeoayTocKjv4yloJydnqiybq3FrZyrZaaev6K4jK%2BgnZ2fYsCpu9asZKmZpKe8r7%2BMop6np6Keu6h50qiaopmcYrGqv9OapZyhnpx6s8HLnqpo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
