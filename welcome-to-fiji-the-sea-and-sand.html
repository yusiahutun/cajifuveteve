Welcome to Fiji: The Sea and Sand Land</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-05-17</div><p class=has-text-align-right>(Source-timesnownews)</p><p>All of us wish to head to the islands at some point in time. If you’re planning your next holiday to an island, we suggest you think about Fiji. It is an island country in Melanesia, a part of Oceania in the South Pacific Ocean. It lies about 2000 km north-west of New Zealand. With approximately 322 islands, the most important islands are Vanua Levu and Viti Levu. An archipelago in the South Pacific Ocean, it also surrounds the Koro Sea which is about 1300 miles north of Auckland, New Zealand. It has a complex geologic history. The Vanua Levu has an area of about 5,540 kms and Viti Levu has an area of about 10,000 kms.&nbsp;</p><p>The Vanua Levu is divided along its length by a mountain range with peaks rising to more than 3000 feet. The Viti Levu accounts for more than half of the island’s land area. A jagged dividing range running from North to South has several peaks above 3,000 feet. To the southeast and southwest, as well as to the south where the range divides, the mountains make the roads clear for plateaus and lowlands. Talking about the climate in Fiji’s capital, Suva, the average summer high temperature is about 29 degrees Celsius and the average winter low is 20 degrees Celsius. The temperatures are typically lower in elevated inland areas.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How did the Island get its name?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1.1-Taveuni-Hill-Fort-Source-lonelyplanet.jpg><p>The Tu’I Tonga Empire ruled over Fiji and brought Polynesian influences to the island. The locals called their home Vita, the Tongan people called it Fisi. According to history about Fiji, many assume Captain Cook botched the name, calling the islands Fiji and the name stayed.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Culture:</h2><p>The culture has evolved throughout the nation’s history, being shaped by influences from Melanesia, Europe, India, and beyond. Fijian people love their family and community. They are warm, friendly, and approachable. They love to express their love of life with a ubiquitous and enthusiastic Bula!&nbsp;</p><p>Fijian people live an unhurried life and they fondly call their time Fiji time. When you are there, expect time to go slow. Even you get easily accustomed to their environment and learn to live in the present.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Religion:</h2><p>As diverse cultures and races exist in the island country, several religions are practiced in the country. Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam are some of those. Religions tend to split along ethnic lines with most Indigenous populations practicing Christianity and most Indo-Fijians practicing Hinduism and Islam.&nbsp;</p><p>As you traverse the Fijian islands, you’ll come across Christian churches, Sikh and Hindu temples, and Islamic mosques. To get to know the core of their culture we’d suggest you attend the Sunday service. It is a special occasion in all cultural temples that celebrate their culture and share short stories and theories about the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tourist Attractions:&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1.2-Religion_-Source-Creator_-Maksym-Kozlenko-.jpg><p>Fiji gained popularity gradually due to its attractive oceans in the Pacific Ocean.
