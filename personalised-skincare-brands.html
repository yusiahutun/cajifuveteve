Often a case of trial and error, many of us will experiment with various products and ingredients in the hope that, in time, we’ll see results. While this is sometimes the case, the process of elimination can be costly, time-consuming, and occasionally risky.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But what of a different way to shop for skincare, one that removes the guesswork? Enter the custom-made. Recently gaining traction, more and more consumers are buying into brands that offer personalised products formulated with your specific skin needs and goals in mind. “The public are starting to realise that one size does not fit all and that a personalised approach to skincare can yield superior results,” says <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.dremmacraythorne.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dr Emma Craythorne" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Dr Emma Craythorne</a>, consultant dermatologist and founder of Klira.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The concept makes sense. Instead of wasting money on unnecessary products, these forward-thinking brands will recommend specific formulations to address your specific needs (following an online skin assessment). “Different skin types require different ingredients and formulations,” confirms Dr Craythorne. “Like shoes or clothes, creams need to ‘fit the skin’ and some styles or, in the case of creams, formulations suit some skin types better than others.”</p><img alt="background made with many petri dishes with different cosmetics and a glass bottle with a face serum and a pipette on gray background concept of cosmetics laboratory researches photography in flat lay style" title="Background made with many Petri dishes with different cosmetics and a glass bottle with a face serum and a pipette on gray background.

Using questionnaires and/or images, the tool will be able to gather information not only about your skin, but also about your lifestyle to generate personalised recommendations.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At Klira, the process begins with an in-depth questionnaire covering medical history, lifestyle and skin type. “The reason why there are so many questions is that we’re essentially replacing an in-clinic appointment,” explains Dr Craythorne. Customers then upload photographs of their face before their ‘SkinSize’ is calculated – “this is our secret weapon for helping you understand the epigenetics and genetics of your skin.” A four-step routine is then devised, which includes a bespoke Klira product.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Custom skincare brands Dermatica and Skin + Me work in a similar way. Following short online questionnaires and image uploads, the expert dermatology teams will prescribe a plan. As with Klira, the bespoke products will contain prescription-strength ingredients (like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a40918028/tretinoin/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=tretinoin class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">tretinoin</a>) that aren’t available over the counter. “There are a variety of strengths and ingredients used depending on the concerns of the individual customer,” explains <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.dermatica.co.uk/skinlab/author/ash-sharma/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dr Ash Sharma" data-vars-ga-product-id=cfb1de1c-09c5-4b1a-ad79-9f90dec2e868 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.dermatica.co.uk/skinlab/author/ash-sharma/ data-product-url=https://www.dermatica.co.uk/skinlab/author/ash-sharma/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dermatica.co.uk%2Fskinlab%2Fauthor%2Fash-sharma%2F" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=fe85588f-28f3-4eb2-a835-17542a451fa6 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Dr Ash Sharma</a>, medical doctor for Dermatica.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">These brands all work on a subscription model, meaning you pay a monthly fee (there are also options to pay quarterly or yearly) to receive regular top-ups of your bespoke formula. “The formulation and ingredient strengths will change each month to evolve with the skin’s tolerance,” says <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.skinandme.com/meet-the-team data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dr Jason Thomson" data-vars-ga-product-id=dbfe1a1c-fd5d-4a9f-8604-41f45f8b699e data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.skinandme.com/meet-the-team data-product-url=https://www.skinandme.com/meet-the-team data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skinandme.com%2Fmeet-the-team" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand="What people say" data-vars-ga-product-price=$7,044,467.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=e71f886a-d695-4438-9c66-fd98149e386a data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="What people say" class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Dr Jason Thomson</a>, dermatologist and head of medical at Skin + Me. “Customers can also check-in with an expert to discuss their progress at any time, free of charge.”</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for #SkinSchool: Adult acne causes and treatments" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/thumbnail-1-1588670700.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>What are the benefits of personalised skincare?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Personalised skincare gives people access to the right combinations of active ingredients to target their specific skin concerns, at concentrations that will work best for their skin,” says <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.skinandme.com/meet-the-team data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dr Malvina Cunningham" data-vars-ga-product-id=dbfe1a1c-fd5d-4a9f-8604-41f45f8b699e data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.skinandme.com/meet-the-team data-product-url=https://www.skinandme.com/meet-the-team data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skinandme.com%2Fmeet-the-team" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand="What people say" data-vars-ga-product-price=$7,044,467.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=e71f886a-d695-4438-9c66-fd98149e386a data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="What people say" class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Dr Malvina Cunningham</a>, consultant dermatologist at And Begin (Skin + Me’s sister brand). Rather than using generic off-the-shelf products, custom-made skincare ensures your specific skin concerns are targeted. “If there are certain ingredients your skin really needs, we put them in – and if there are ingredients you skin would do better without (like some preservatives or cosmeceuticals), we leave them out,” adds Dr Craythorne.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Custom-made also means it’s fresh. At Klira and Dermatica, the products are blended in London labs and delivered straight to the customers door within 48-hours so that the formulation is at its best with less degradation. “People want fresh products with minimal additional preservatives in,” notes Dr Craythorne, “they want ingredients that are at their peak potency and haven’t been stored on the shelf for months or years”.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Freshness aside, many personalised skin services offer access to a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/news/a37809/cosmetic-procedure-guide-best-dermatologist/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="dermatology specialist" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">dermatology specialist</a> for check-ins. “There are thousands of people across the country on the waiting list for a dermatology appointment,” flags Dr Sharma. “More than 8,000 people are currently waiting for an appointment in Scotland alone, and while those who can afford it go private, the prescription fees exclude the vast majority of people in the UK from accessing these services.” By offering online consultations, these brands have democratised access to seeing dermatology experts with treatment at affordable prices.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Are there any risks associated with personalised skincare?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“While I understand that not everyone can see a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/news/a37809/cosmetic-procedure-guide-best-dermatologist/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=dermatologist class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">dermatologist</a>, the current trend of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/g36605247/best-online-dermatology-services/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="virtual consultations" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">virtual consultations</a> and prescriptions has unfortunately led to a concerning rise of misdiagnosis,” says <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://selflondon.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dr Anjali Mahto" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Dr Anjali Mahto</a>, consultant dermatologist at Self London. “It’s not unusual for me to see four-to-six patients a week who have been diagnosed with acne by an online prescription service, but they actually have rosacea or vice versa.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The point of having regular check-ins with a dermatologist specialist is to minimise these risks. “Our dermatology team will not treat any skin condition that they are not confident in diagnosing from the photographs provided,” says Dr Thomson. “And while there are always potential risks when applying treatments onto the skin – the benefit of personalisation means irritating ingredients, like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a31278199/best-retinol-cream/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=retinoids class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">retinoids</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/g40044892/azelaic-acid/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="azelaic acid" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">azelaic acid</a>, can be added at lower strengths and gradually increased to reduce this risk.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The risks of bespoke personalised skincare are far less than the ‘DIY’ model,” says Dr Craythorne. In her practise, Dr Craythorne often sees patients who have made their skin worse by using the wrong products and/or incompatible ingredients. According to her, the main risk associated with personalised skincare is that the customer may think they have seen a dermatologist when they’ve actually seen a ‘skincare expert’ – which isn’t the same thing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I think it is important that you see a real dermatologist, or a team led by a dermatologist as that is how the skin nuances and diagnoses are detected and best plans are made,” she says.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for #SkinSchool: A guide to retinol" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/bd335e54-93e9-40ca-ba40-9a99ed1bc388/thumb_1920x1080_00002_1580825138_16637.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>The top personalised skincare brands in the business…</strong></h2><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>1. </strong><strong>Dermatica</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Noticing a need for dermatology-recommended skincare, health entrepreneur Dwayne D’Souza dreamt up Dermatica.
