I have been seeing sprinklings of the shoe for a while now, but had a feeling it was destined for 'It' shoe status when I saw Bella Hadid wearing a yellow pair on TikTok. She was doing jumping jacks and hopping out of a mini fridge wearing them while on set for something. The Bella effect is real, and I honestly think she's the reason the Adidas Sambas blew up to the extent they did amongst a stylish set who otherwise wouldn't consider wearing an indoor soccer shoes with their The RealReal grails.

And, crucially, she wasn't paid to wear them—they're a style she actually liked and bought herself, according to Onitsuka's head of content, who I emailed to ask about it. The brand also told me that the same situation applies to a pair Kaia Gerber wore recently.</p><img alt="kaia gerber wearing black separates in a story about onitsuka mexico 66 sneakers 2023" title="Onitsuka Mexico 66 Sneakers 2023" width=2200 height=3300 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bgus-2494522-030-644148081f938.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Backgrid</span><p>Kaia Gerber wears her yellow Onitsuka sneakers with an all-black outfit (and green juice).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I find this shoe's resurgence so interesting because, like the Samba, it's been around for a-g-e-s. The earliest iteration, the Onitsuka Cortez, was released in 1969. Then the brand was revamped in 2002 with a re-release of the sneaker everyone is wearing now. (This Slack history lesson has been brought to you by a corporate PDF, ha.) The shoe hasn't changed all that much over all these decades: It's still a low-top, almost ballet-flat-adjacent sneaker with spiky soles, a curved toe, and arced stripes along the sides.</p><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">Onitsuka Tiger Mexico 66 Sneaker</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$130 at Asics for Mexico 66 Sneaker" data-href=https://www.asics.com/ca/en-ca/unisex-mexico-66-dl408-0490 data-product-url=https://www.asics.com/ca/en-ca/unisex-mexico-66-dl408-0490 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asics.com%2Fca%2Fen-ca%2Funisex-mexico-66-dl408-0490" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$130 at Asics" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.asics.com/ca/en-ca/unisex-mexico-66-dl408-0490 data-vars-ga-product-brand="Onitsuka Tiger" data-vars-ga-product-id=c85768b7-2d7b-498d-8e68-5a056754017d data-vars-ga-product-price=$130.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=bfb506ff-0e5a-43df-a4bb-a444c95921ea data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Onitsuka Tiger" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category=Architectural data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="Mexico 66 Sneaker" title="Mexico 66 Sneaker" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1682000175-onitsuka-mexico-66-sneakers-yellow-644148f1be67d.png width=1172 height=1224 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">Onitsuka Tiger Mexico 66 Sneaker</h2></p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Credit: Asics</span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Design-wise, this feels so right for right now.

I honestly think that's the appeal of the sneaker, there's something really exciting about seeing it out of context that resonates with how people are dressing today. When I think of Gen Z and their interest in personal style...I think of sneakers like the Samba or the Onitsuka worn with a vintage leopard print Blumarine skirt or a great penny lane coat. Just like every generation before them, they want to look cool—who doesn't?!—but I think their definition of what cool looks like is really different.</p><img alt="los angeles, ca january 12 addison rae is seen on january 12, 2023 in los angeles, california photo by hollywood to youstar maxgc images" title="Celebrity Sightings In Los Angeles - January 12, 2023" width=2520 height=3147 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1246193376-6442c05eb68a7.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Hollywood To You/Star Max</span><p>Addison Rae wearing the Onitsukas in Melrose Place this past January. The TikTok star owns the Mexico 66 sneaker in multiple colors and is frequently seen wearing them.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For a while, especially in the 2010s, looking cool was synonymous with curation: An aesthetic muted instagram grid, the kind of hair that never has a stray out of place, outfits that followed the conventional style rules...full looks and lots of matching. The thing that makes people look "cool" right now, in 2023, is when they don't look like they're really trying—that's why everyone is still so enamored with the effortlessness of the '90s. When you throw on a pair of Onitsukas with a vintage Dior slip nightgown, it looks haphazard in a real spunky way. Like...oh, that girl wore a pair of sneakers because she's actually going to live her life today in that outfit doing things.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>HL: </strong>I definitely see so many downtown doyenne, true-Fashion-People interpretations of this sneaker, in the style of the white Salomon sneakers Bella Hadid has also worn or the New Balance 550s. But I think this sneaker has comeback potential outside of New York and Los Angeles style circles, too. I don't think we've mentioned enough just how COMFORTABLE these are, or how many more color combos there are than the yellow Uma Thurman pair.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So I have to ask–have you been taking inspiration from Gen Z with the way you've worn yours? Or somewhere else entirely?</p><img alt="street style paris fashion week womenswear fall winter 2023 2024 day three" title="Onitsuka Mexico 66 Sneakers 2023" width=3112 height=4495 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/model-is-seen-wearing-a-black-leather-coat-black-and-white-news-photo-1682001602.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Daniel Zuchnik</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>At Paris Fashion Week last season, guests wore their Onitsukas with striped T-shirts and statement coats.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>TG: </strong>It's funny because I never, ever, used to really wear sneakers. All throughout high school and college I stuck to lace up boxing boots (which are also having a moment right now, but that's a different story) or lug-sole platform shoes. Something about sneakers didn't feel very me in a way I can't really pinpoint. I was actually a complete introvert growing up—which would, I think, be a bit shocking to most people who know me now—and I think a large part of me coming into my own confidence was pushing myself to dress in really weird, unexpected ways. I felt like my personality was trapped in this anxious shyness and clothing was the only way I could express how I really felt and eventually escape it.</p><img alt="onitsuka sneakers" title="onitsuka sneakers" width=3024 height=4032 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-4469-6442b4556cde8.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Tara Gonzalez</span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But in the last couple of years, I think seeing people wear sneakers like the Onitsukas, which I grew up admiring on the cool older girls on my track team at practice, out of context has really excited me. I don't feel comfortable wearing a head-to-toe feminine look most of the time, I like to add hard elements, and the Onitsukas do just that in my eyes. This past weekend I wore them with a Vaquera t-shirt featuring a pug wearing a spiked collar, an asymmetrical white lace skirt, and a vintage YSL Mombasa bag with that signature tough horn handle, and people kept coming up to tell me how cool they thought the shoes were. But I think what's cool about the shoes is less the shoes themselves and more how they took that look to a really unpredictable place. How do you find yourself wearing them?</p><img alt="onitsuka sneakers" title="onitsuka sneakers" width=3024 height=4032 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-4796-6442bf3506595.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Tara Gonzalez</span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>HL:</strong> So I'll start by saying that there's a substantial gap between the way I think I dress and the way I actually dress. I'm having a moment where I'm obsessed with a pair of Miu Miu ballet flats I recently acquired and I wouldn't ever, ever call myself a sneakerhead. I only learned what Grailed was, like, a year ago. But cleaning out my closet over weekend, I took inventory and discovered I have more than 20 pairs of sneakers. 20, including three hard-to-find New Balance collaborations! It was a moment of existential wardrobing crisis.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When I reflected on it some more, I had to admit that I wear a variation of a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/g43552607/best-white-sneakers/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="white sneaker" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">white sneaker</a> 95% of the time, and one of them is now a pair of white Onitsukas with slate blue-green accents. The pair I have isn't as flashy as the yellow ones that are all over the place, but that's why they work for me: It's a sneaker I can slip on with a car coat, oversized trousers, and a baseball cap for market appointments (like a few weeks ago), or with a flouncy, puff-sleeve Ganni sundress with a sweater vest layered on top (like last weekend), or with jeans or a matching yoga set to walk my dog (pretty much every morning when I wake up). I love adventurous outfits on other people, but I like to dress most days like I'm a designer giving their runway finale bow myself: somewhat minimal and not overthought, usually with a trouser and some crewneck layers.</p><img alt="a harper's bazaar editor wears onitsuka sneakers in a post about the onitsuka mexico 66 sneakers 2023" title="Onitsuka Mexico 66 Sneakers 2023" width=3024 height=4032 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-7335-64414a4a709ab.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Halie LeSavage</span><img alt="a bazaar editor wears a black blazer and chinos in a story about the onitsuka mexico 66 sneakers 2023" title="Onitsuka Mexico 66 Sneakers 2023" width=3024 height=4032 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-7131-64414bad003ff.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Halie LeSavage</span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But to your point, these sneakers have the variety to open up a whole universe of outfits and places to wear them.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>TG: </strong>I just love that these days, especially in the past I'd say three weeks, I keep seeing people wearing the Onitsukas every time I leave my house. And normally when you see an item that much it feels a little disheartening, as if people are just copy and pasting some trend they saw on Instagram. But I don't feel that way with these! It doesn't feel like a trend just because everyone I see wearing them is wearing them so differently. It's almost like everyone saw all the unexpected ways people were styling these sneakers and are using them as a catalyst for their own personal style. And it's so exciting to see people having fun with their style, all thanks to a $130 Japanese athletic shoe from 1949.
