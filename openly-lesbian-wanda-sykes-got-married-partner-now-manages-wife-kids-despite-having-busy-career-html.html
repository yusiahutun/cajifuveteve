She&nbsp;then stated,</p><p style=text-align:justify>&nbsp;“Babies are very inconsiderate! Everyone said twins should be here at 35 weeks but nothing! Lots of waiting and they finally induced at week 39. I was [in the delivery room] when they did the C-Section. When the doctors tell you “Don’t look this way,”&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;look that way. It was not pretty.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>Also, when Jay asked if the twin babies calmed down after they reached home, she hilariously added, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-600 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=600 style="float:none!important;margin-top:15px!important;margin-left:auto!important;text-align:center!important;min-width:580px;min-height:400px;width:580px;margin-bottom:15px!important;max-width:580px;padding:0;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;border:0 solid #ddd!important;margin-right:auto!important;display:block!important;line-height:0;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important"></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>“No!

I mean, I don’t even think they know each other.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Amazingly, the same-sex marriage activist seems&nbsp;to be managing her professional life and personal life hand in hand.</p><p>In an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with Windsor Star in 2015, Wanda had said she wouldn't bring her kids to work. She said,</p><p style=text-align:justify>“I don’t like bringing them on the road.&nbsp;I look at it as work. If I worked at a construction site, say, driving a forklift truck, I wouldn’t want the kids joining me there. It’s the same thing as going on tour.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>She then continued,</p><p style=text-align:justify>“Sometimes, if I know she’s in the audience, I will deliberately bring up something we had been discussing just to test it on the audience. If they agree with me, I’ll tease her about it afterwards.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>While Wanda was against bringing her kids to work, she did spend quality time with her kids. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-601 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=601 style="margin-right:auto!important;margin-left:auto!important;border:0 solid #ddd!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;display:block!important;min-width:336px;padding:0;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;width:580px;float:none!important;text-align:center!important;margin-top:15px!important;min-height:400px;max-width:580px;line-height:0;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important"></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><p>The American celeb showcased one of her beautiful moments with her kids in August 2017. Wanda and her kids were seen spending time painting on canvas together in the video featured on Micheal Stores' Youtube channel.&nbsp;</p><p>Previously, in an interview with PEOPLE in August 2014, Wanda had talked about parenting and her bond with kids. To People, she had said,&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>&nbsp;“As a parent, it’s just good to sit down together and keep them busy and do something together as a family.”</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-602 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=602 style="margin-right:auto!important;text-align:center!important;max-width:580px;line-height:0;border:0 solid #ddd!important;display:block!important;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;float:none!important;margin-top:15px!important;min-width:336px;width:580px;margin-bottom:15px!important;margin-left:auto!important;min-height:400px;padding:0"></span>According to <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Vulture</a>, she spoke about being sleep deprived as a result of parenting in 2016. She admitted to thinking of returning one of her kids since she was unable to get adequate sleep. Don’t worry it was just a joke. She loves her kids.</p><p>She also noted how difficult it was for her to assist her children with their schoolwork. Summer vacation was the most difficult for her since she had to read books with her children. She described herself as a mess as school was about to begin, and they were unable to finish their books on time.</p><p>In the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with The Hollywood Reporters, Wanda also mentioned how weary she and her spouse were during the pandemic. They had to split household tasks and care for their children. During the pandemic, Wanda worked as a cafeteria woman, janitor, and hall monitor in her home. She expressed her exhaustion and inability to spend quality time with her wife.</p><p>Even if Wanda's life was difficult, it's comforting to know that she managed to hit a healthy balance between job and family. She seemed to be happy, despite having faced so much suffering in her life. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-603 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=603 style="line-height:0;width:580px;float:none!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;display:block!important;min-height:400px;max-width:580px;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;margin-top:15px!important;margin-left:auto!important;min-width:250px;border:0 solid #ddd!important;margin-right:auto!important;text-align:center!important;padding:0;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important"></span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Wanda Sykes&nbsp;Comes Out As Gay!</h2><p style=text-align:justify>The Virginia native publicly came out&nbsp;back in November 2008 at a protest rally after California voters passed "Proposition 8", a ban on same-sex marriage. During the event, Wanda gave a spontaneous speech revealing her sexuality at the event,&nbsp;which she had "no intentions" of making.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Fellow Lesbian In Our Vault:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Meet Lesbian Player Layshia Clarendon's Wife & Know About Her Married Life</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Also in 2010, she had given a worthwhile stand-up comedy performance titled 'I'ma Be Me - Gay vs.&nbsp;Black,' published by HBO, where she joked about the differences between being black and gay.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Later, in an interview with CNN in June 2011, Wanda explained how she came out during the protest rally,&nbsp;stating,&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-604 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=604 style="margin-right:auto!important;width:580px;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;padding:0;margin-top:15px!important!important;float:none!important;margin-bottom:15px!important!important;min-width:580px;min-height:0!important;border:0 solid #ddd!important;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;margin-left:auto!important;display:flex!important;text-align:center!important;max-width:580px;line-height:0"></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>"I kind of shocked myself. I was in the middle of it, and it was from anger."</p><p style=text-align:justify>Also, the former writer of The Chris Rock show added the pros and cons of coming out during the interview, saying,</p><p style=text-align:justify>"The worst thing, I guess, is just dealing with it, you know, like with family, and it's not necessarily the worst thing but, man, it's like every day I get invited to some&nbsp;gay&nbsp;event, you know. It's like, can you come to this gay event? Can you come support this? And it's like, good Lord, if I go show up at all these gay events, I'm not going to make any money. I'm going to be a broke gay. I'm going to be the brokest lesbian out there."&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>In the same month in 2011, Wanda also appeared on the show,&nbsp;PIERS MORGAN TONIGHT,&nbsp;where she said it was hard being gay than black.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-605 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Later, she also went to Oprah's show,&nbsp;Oprah’s Next Chapter in October 2013 to&nbsp;spill&nbsp;the beans about her lesbian sexuality.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>On the show, the Hampton University graduate revealed that she first disclosed her sexuality to her mother over the phone when her age was 40.</p><p style=text-align:justify><img alt="Wanda Sykes with her mother" height=444 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com//uploads/images/lrualbum/Wanda-Sykes-Mother.jpg width=445 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-625 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=625 style="text-align:center!important;max-width:580px;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;width:580px;float:none!important;margin-right:auto!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;min-height:400px;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;margin-left:auto!important;display:block!important;padding:0;margin-top:15px!important;min-width:336px;line-height:0;border:0 solid #ddd!important"></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Wanda wished her mother on mother's day.

She was confused about her sexuality at first, but she started dating women after her divorce from her husband of seven years, Dave Hall, an award-winning record producer.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify>Nevertheless, on The Oprah Winfrey Show, the famous actress/comedian also said that she was finally able to share the intimate connection, which was lacking in her first marriage, after meeting her wife.</p><p style=text-align:justify>However, she had previously cleared that she didn't divorce her husband because of her sexuality. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-627 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=627 style="margin-right:auto!important;padding:0;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;width:580px;margin-left:auto!important;text-align:center!important;min-width:336px;float:none!important;max-width:580px;min-height:400px;line-height:0;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;border:0 solid #ddd!important;margin-top:15px!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;display:block!important"></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><img alt="Wanda Sykes with her wife" height=424 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com//uploads/images/lrualbum/Wanda-Sykes-Wife.jpg width=445 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Wanda completes 13 years together with her wife.

Later in 2017, Wanda also made her appearance on The Ellen Show. It was her&nbsp;30th Appearance on the show.</p><p style=text-align:justify>An actress in the 2018 movie&nbsp;Hurricane Bianca 2: From Russia with Hate,&nbsp;Wanda talked about comedy and her kids with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Ellen Degeneres</a>, who had portrayed the first openly&nbsp;gay&nbsp;or lesbian lead character on television.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-628 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=628 style="background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;border:0 solid #ddd!important;text-align:center!important;line-height:0;float:none!important;margin-left:auto!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;display:block!important;min-width:300px;min-height:400px;max-width:580px;padding:0;width:580px;margin-top:15px!important;margin-right:auto!important"></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Likewise, in August 2017, Wanda&nbsp;brought same-sex parenting to Disney Jr.’s ‘Doc McStuffins,' reasoning her decision to join the&nbsp;show was for personal reasons.

[The episode] was not about them being a same-sex couple. They just happened to be. It's so funny because that's the way my kids watched that episode. They didn't say, "Hey, it's two moms. They said, ""Hey, do we have an emergency plan?""</p><p style=text-align:justify>It must have been an emotional coming-out process for Wanda.
