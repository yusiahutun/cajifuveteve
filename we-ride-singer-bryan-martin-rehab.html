He goes on to explain how alcohol and addiction have always been a problem for him, so he's taking this time to get back on track.</p><p>"I wanted to be the one to tell my fans first ... so share the post whatever ya wanna do ... it may get taken down but I can promise you guys. I’m standing strong as always and I’ll be back in no time."</p><p>His candor in sharing this news is representative of who Martin is. Fans know he's been here before.</p><h3>Who Is Bryan Martin?</h3><p>The first paragraph of Martin’s biography alludes to a suicide attempt that he&nbsp;describes later. The modern traditionalist paints a picture of growing up in a broken or chaotic household, which led to drug and alcohol use as a teenager.</p><p>He dropped out of high school, but got clean in the military. After returning home, a feeling of failure led to him taking 30 Percocet and trying to shoot himself. The gun misfired.</p><p>“My first song came from a suicide note,” he shares.</p><p>Life has dealt him ups and downs in the 16 years since that day, and he’s resolved to be open about all of it.</p><p>"I wear the scars, and I’m learning to wear it better. The reason why I don’t hide anything is because there’s too many people that need to know that there is no difference between me and them."</p><p>It's not clear how long he'll remain in a rehabilitation facility or how the stay will&nbsp;effect future shows. His next concert is scheduled for Feb. 22 in Texas.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>18 Country Artists Who Are Sober</h2><p>Although country music is known for its raucous drinking songs, several artists have sworn off the stuff completely.
