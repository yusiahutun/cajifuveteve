She worked as a waitress to feed herself while performing folk music in the coffee houses of Greenwich Village.</p><p>After becoming something of a star, Emily Lou put her musical career on hold for a short time after her marriage to give herself some time to get used to married life. The break lasted longer than many fans expected, but later returned to her passion when the said marriage broke up and they divorced. While performing the songs of Gerry Mule and Tom Guidera in a certain bar, she met the renowned “Flying Burrito Brothers”, who introduced her to her former bandleader Gram Parsons. This meeting was exactly what Emmylou needed, as Parsons was looking for a singer to work with on his debut solo album, GP. They toured together and made an album – Grievous Angel- which was released posthumously in 1974 after Parsons died on September 19, 1973.</p><p>Parsons’ death eventually prompted Lou to move to Los Angeles after she signed with Reprise Record after forming her own vocal group, which she called “Angel Band”. She worked with her second husband, producer Brian Ahern, to produce what would later become her ten most important albums. Her first major debut album Pieces of the sky was released in 1975, and the album featured a diverse fusion of covers from The Beatles to Merle Haggard.</p><p>Harris’ second award-winning album Elite Hotel was recorded with a newly formed band called “Hot Band”. They released five more albums; Luxury Liner, Quarter Moon in a Ten Cent Town, Profile: The Best of Emmylou Harris, and Blue Kentucky Girl in the 1970s. The latter earned her a second Grammy award.</p><p>Her third husband, Paul Kennerly, worked with her to release a semi-autobiographical album entitled “The Ballad of Sally” and two other solo albums – Thirteen and The Angel Band. She also recorded a trio with other country stars such as Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt in 1987, which became the best-selling album of all time in Lou’s entire singing career.</p><p>In 1995 she released her experimental album “Wrecking Ball” which became a huge hit and earned her a Grammy. In 2000 she released more albums and her last single was released in 2013.</p><p>In total, she has successfully released 26 studio albums, three live albums, 11 compilation albums, three video albums, and 70 singles. Harris has won 13 Grammy awards and three CMA awards.</p><h2><strong>Her Husband and Daughter</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Harris-Ahern-Husband.jpg><p>EmmyLou Harris met and married songwriter Tom Slocum in 1969 at a gig in Greenwich Village.
