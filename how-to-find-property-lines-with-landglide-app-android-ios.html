Traditionally, this is the only way to figure out where your property lines begin and end. However, surveys are expensive—sometimes costing thousands of dollars. Maybe there is another way.</p><p>The LandGlide app is designed to help people find their property lines using their smartphones. Thanks to advanced parcel data and the GPS on your device, LandGlide features up-to-date data that can show you where your property lines are.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=how-to-find-your-property-lines-with-landglide>How to Find Your Property Lines With LandGlide</h2><p>Finding your property lines with LandGlide is easy. To get started, just download the app and insert your address at the top when it opens. LandGlide will find your property and show you the property lines. If you haven’t bought a house yet, there are <a href=#>apps that can help find your dream home</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/landglide-property-line.jpg><p>LandGlide has a satellite feature that can help you identify where your property lines are. While Google Maps also has boundary lines, LandGlide is more accurate. After all, LandGlide sources its information directly from the county. You can also use the GPS feature to show you where you are relative to your property lines. When you walk around, you can find out how close you are to your property line and mark it yourself.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/landglide-parcel-lines.jpg><p>You can also use LandGlide to find surveyor pins to get the property line. This is helpful if you need to know where the line is for a fence or for a building. To find a surveyor pin using LandGlide, you just need a metal detector. Then, open the app and start scanning the boundary lines of the property. The Surveyor pin will be close by and show up as a small piece of iron on the metal detector.</p><p>Although <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LandGlide</a> says it offers “fairly accurate” parcel lines, they should not be relied on for any legal purposes. For that, you still need a surveyor.</p><h2 id=how-to-find-the-owner-of-a-property>How to Find the Owner of a Property</h2><p>If you need to contact a neighbor, or are curious as to who owns a property, you can do this using LandGlide as well. Since LandGlide includes parcel data for most properties in the United States, you can also find the contact information of the owner.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>This is helpful if there’s a vacant property next to yours and you need to contact the owner. Some people use this feature to contact the owner and make an offer to expand their property. It will also bring up information on acreage, value, elevation, and more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/landglide-property-data.jpg><p>To find the owner, all you need to do is tap on the parcel on the LandGlide app. This will bring up their information. This is also helpful for realtors and property investors. LandGlide, along with these <a href=#>must-have apps for realtors</a>, can help boost your business.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><strong>Download:</strong> LandGlide for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS </a>| <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a> (Subscription required, free trial available)</p><h2 id=are-surveyors-a-thing-of-the-past>Are Surveyors a Thing of the Past?</h2><p>With apps like LandGlide, it can be easy to think that we won’t need surveyors as much in the future, but that is far from the case. Although GPS parcel data helps you find approximate property lines without hiring a surveyor, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LandGlide</a> itself states that its properly lines “are not recommended to use for legal purposes.” Surveys are expensive and take weeks to complete, so LandGlide can offer a quick and easy solution for trivial matters. But you shouldn't rely on it for much more than that.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>If you and your neighbor are having a property dispute, the LandGlide parcel data isn’t accepted in court cases. For this, you’ll need an actual survey. LandGlide is also only available to those in the US. While 95 percent of the US population is covered, if you’re in the five percent that isn’t, it won’t be helpful.</p><p>Either way, the LandGlide app is a great option for some cases, and you might not need a surveyor at all if you don't need the properly lines for a legal matter. Before spending time and money on a survey, give LandGlide a try first.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGifqK9dqbxussinm2aooqS9pr7TsmSloZ6awG7DyK2fZqSRo7GouMidnGaZoKV6orrDq6ainF2evLR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
