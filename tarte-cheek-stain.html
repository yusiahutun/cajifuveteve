That happened to me just by looking at photos of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Tarte’s Cheek Stain</a>. It was all of a sudden 1999 again and I was in middle school applying the gel <a href=# id=auto-tag_blush data-tag=blush>blush</a> right on the apples of my cheeks, probably using too much and blending with my fingers and making a mess. I loved&nbsp;that blush and I never felt cooler than when I swiped it on right from the stick. It seems everyone is feeling nostalgic because <a href=# id=auto-tag_tarte data-tag=tarte>Tarte</a> brought back this iconic product after more than two decades. (Wow, I’m old.)</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anua-heartleaf-toner-tiktok.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/olivercabellsneakersale.png><p>Maureen Kelly, founder and CEO of Tarte, created her first product, a cheek stain, out of her NYC apartment. It became a massive best-seller because, at the time, there really weren’t many cream or stick blushes — definitely not like there is now.&nbsp;The rest was history and <a href=#>Tarte was born</a>. Now, more than two decades later (again, old!), Tarte has listened to fans who have been begging the cheek stains to make a comeback and re-released three&nbsp;iconic shades: the OG Flush (a red berry), Tipsy (a warm coral) and Exposed (a luminous neutral).</p><p>For a limited time, you can grab them in an affordable set (a $78.12 value!) Choose from two different shade combinations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/tarte-cheek-stain-duo.png><p>If you’re not an <a href=#>old millennial</a> like me and aren’t familiar with Tarte’s Cheek Stains, you’re in for a treat. The vegan formula contains sustainably harvested maracuja, as well as what the brand calls T5 Superfruit Complex, an antioxidant blend of goji, acai, acerola, pomegranate and maracuja. It’s made&nbsp;with up to 36 percent water so feels cool on the skin.&nbsp;The result is seriously hydrating but not at all greasy. Plus, the stain really lasts all day and is buildable from a more natural look to a dramatic pop of color.</p><p>Right now, your best bet is to grab the duo at a discount on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">QVC’s website</a>&nbsp;while you can. Then, Tarte Cheek Stain will be available at <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Sephora</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Ulta Beauty</a> on March 20.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/banner-newsletter-beauty_july2020.jpg alt="STYLECASTER | Ashley Benson Interview" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLqit8Sup2hpYmqDeoKRaKuaqqSaeqS0xJ6iZquklravew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
