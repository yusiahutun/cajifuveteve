It’s been credited with helping with the glowing skin Japanese geishas always seemed to have. It’s naturally packed with antioxidants, catechins (a substance that helps protect cells from damage caused by free radicals), <a href=# rel=noopener>EGCG</a> (a compound that reduces inflammation) and caffeine, explains aesthetician and ‘skinfluencer’ <a href=# rel=noopener>Cassandra Bankson</a>. This makes it phenomenal for skin subjected to pollution, changes in weather and damage from other sources, such as over-exfoliation and the sun.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Matcha benefits for skin</h2><p>“While matcha has been around for thousands of years, it has only recently become a buzzword in skincare because other ingredients have a hard time competing,” says Bankson. Plus, this age-old remedy is anti-aging. Studies have shown that the phytochemicals found in green tea can <a href=# rel=noopener>increase collagen production and prevent it from breaking down</a>, which is a massive factor in how quickly your skin ages.&nbsp;(Click through for more <a href=#>ways to up collagen production</a>.)</p><p>“Matcha can smooth and soothe skin, decrease lines and wrinkles and other forms of aging and may even help redness and acne. It is widely available in cleansers, moisturizers, toners, masks and serums,” says <a href=# rel=noopener>Jodi LoGerfo, DNP, APRN, FNP-C</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>You can also get those same, healthy matcha benefits for skin by drinking it daily, plus a few other perks. “Daily consumption of green tea may have other benefits too, like improving cognitive function, weight reduction, managing blood sugar levels and even help prevent certain types of cancer,” says Dr. LoGerfo.&nbsp;Need any more reason to pour yourself a steaming hot cup of matcha green tea or slather on a matcha mask?

Green tea (both topical and oral) may help because of its antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and regenerative properties,” says Dr. LoGerfo. These properties make it a <a href=# rel=noopener>potentially effective treatment</a> for other skin conditions like eczema, psoriasis and rosacea.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Matcha benefits for skin: It can counteract sun damage&nbsp;</h3><p>UV radiation causes skin inflammation, DNA damage and other adverse effects. “Green tea may have photo-protective effects due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties.
