Aside from the new orange colorway, we could forgive you for wondering what has changed with this $189 upgrade.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The device has retained the curious hip flask shape (complete with the power button/volume dial that looks like a little screw cap), but as we all know, it is what is on the inside that counts, and with the iFi Hip-DAC2, it really counts.</p><p>Want to know why you should be packing this portable powerhouse? OK then, read on; and at the end of this review, we're giving away our test unit to one lucky reader!</p><h2 id=unboxing-the-hip-dac2>Unboxing the Hip-DAC2</h2><p>The Hip-DAC2 is small and portable, so the box it comes in isn't much bigger than the device itself. Opening the box, you'll find:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ifi-hip-dac2-controls-in-hand.jpg><ul><li>Hip-DAC2</li><li>USB 3.0 cable</li><li>USB-A to USB-C cable</li><li>OTG cable</li><li>Device literature</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is everything you need to take your audiophile-quality sounds on the go with you, aside from a source and some headphones, of course!</p><h2 id=taking-a-walk-around-the-ifi-hip-dac2>Taking a Walk Around the iFi Hip-DAC2</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ifi-hip-dac2-with-headphones-plugged-in.jpg><p>With the device out of the box, what exactly are we looking at? Well, in case you're not familiar with the original Hip-DAC, we're looking at a device that perfectly replicates the shape of a small hip flask, the variety you might put a dram of your favorite single malt in (do not attempt to insert a splash of scotch into your new DAC, though).</p><p>The body is made from extruded aluminum and comes in a very pleasing sunset orange color, with the iFi logo in black at the front center. It measures 102 x 70 x 14mm (4.02 x 2.76 x 0.55 inches) and weighs only 125 grams (4.41oz), so it is very much the portable device you want to take with you wherever you go.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the top end of the device, we have a selection of buttons, dials, and outputs. From left to right, we have the Power Match button with its associated LED indicator; the Xbass button with LED; the volume dial/power button sits dead center, with indicator LEDs on either side; then the two outputs for your headphones, in 4.4mm (balanced) and 3.5mm (single-ended) configurations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ifi-hip-dac2-rear-face-labels.jpg><p>All the buttons are physical rather than capacitive, which is nice, and the volume dial turns with buttery smoothness, furnishing a sense of quality from that initial light click that informs you that you've just switched the DAC on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the bottom of the device, you'll see a USB-A input for connecting your phone or PC to the Hip-DAC2, and a USB-C charging input.</p><p>In all, the Hip-DAC2 is very well constructed, with a nice solid hand-feel, and little weight to it, which is important when we consider you'll be carrying it in your pocket or bag with you.</p><h2 id=hip-dac-2-specifications>Hip-DAC 2: Specifications</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>So, the Hip-DAC2 might look pretty similar to the OG Hip-DAC, but iFi certainly beefs things up to make buying it justifiable. For a start, iFi has incorporated a 16-core XMOS chip to process the audio over USB. The previous iteration had an 8-core chip. This means the Hip-DAC2 has doubled the clock speed of the original, and it now brings four times the memory compared to version one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Hip-DAC2 also packs a Burr Bown True Native DAC chipset. This allows you to listen to bit-perfect music, i.e. the sound remains unchanged following processing, meaning no fidelity is lost. Basically, the sound you hear is the same sound that the artist produced in the studio, exactly how you should hear it.</p><p>With this in mind, the latest Hip-DAC2 also sports full MQA (master quality authenticated) decoding, rather than just rendering the files as per the previous iteration. This means that, again, you'll be able to listen to music as the artist intended you to hear it, with the same level of fidelity and detail as when it left the studio.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>iFi has also upgraded the GMT (Global Master Timing) crystal clock system, meaning that the jitter reduces, so sound playback of digital audio will be better thanks to that upgraded clock.</p><p>Jitter, essentially, is a slight mistiming of the sound samples as they travel from the source to the amp or DAC, which then converts the digital signal to an analog one, meaning it can sound distorted when you finally hear the sound through your headphones. Ideally, the timing should remain the same, but it doesn't, which is why you want to reduce jitter as much as possible.</p><p>The Hip-DAC2 also supports Hi-Res audio, with playback of files right through the range, meaning you can playback everything from MP3 through to full DXD384. So, whether you're playing lossy files, or you've plumped for the highest quality available, you can be safe in the knowledge that the iFi Hip-DAC2 can handle it all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It should please you to know that, despite connecting to your smartphone via the USB-C port, the Hip-DAC2 has its own power supply. It takes around three hours to fully charge, according to iFi (I actually tested it at 2.5 hours with a 66W charger), and you then get around eight hours of use, depending on the headphones you're using (note, this only works with wired headphones, not wireless).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The Hip-DAC2 can be used to charge other devices using the OTG charger, and if the battery runs out of juice, you can plug it into a power source and continue to use it while it is charging, which means it is excellent for uninterrupted music that doesn't deplete your smartphone battery.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Finally, in terms of power output, you're getting 400mW at 32 ohms and 6.3V at 600 ohms via the balanced output, and 280mW at 32 ohms or 3.2V at 600 ohms from the single-ended output. So, despite being small, the iFi Hip-DAC2 should have the chops to power even the most demanding of over or on-ear cans.</p><p>So, with specs out of the way, let's see how this little beast performs in practical use.</p><h2 id=ifi-hip-dac2-pure-pocket-powered-performance>iFi Hip-DAC2: Pure Pocket-Powered Performance</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>I've been using the Hip-DAC2 for several weeks now, pairing it with both my smartphone (an Honor Magic5 Pro) and my laptop for playback of music from Tidal (for MQA) and Roon (for FLAC). I also paired it with two sets of (very different) cans in order to test its mettle, see whether it can improve the sound from my headphones at all, and find out whether it can drive a beefy pair of over-ears.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>First up, I paired the Hip-DAC2 with a set of Moondrop Aria IEMs. These are inexpensive IEMs, with a fairly narrow soundstage and imaging. They sound good, but they sound great with the iFi Hip-DAC2 powering them. The soundstage opens up somewhat to offer additional space in which to place the instruments and vocals, with better accuracy than before.</p><p>The bass produced by the Arias is also a little understated, so it delighted me when the Hip-DAC 2 offered some bass extension to the overall sound; more so with the Xbass feature active. Tracks like Buggin' Out by A Tribe Called Quest come to life at the bottom end with the assistance of the Hip-DAC2, when paired with the Arias.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Likewise, the Aria's lower mids don't have as much presence (no surprise, seeing as the bass is recessed), but the Hip-DAC2 successfully brought male vocals forward in the mix, to the point they were on a par with female vocals in terms of presence. We Let It In by Brian Eno sounds fantastic with the Hip-DAC2, where Eno's low-mid vocals had previously sat back a touch.</p><p>The top-end of the Aria's are excellent, with a sparkling, clear quality, and I am happy to say the Hip-DAC2 gives the treble an even airier feel, retaining the crisp, clean treble so that the upper register never fatigues, and still delights the listener with a crystalline quality.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On to my Audeze LCD-5 (you can read my <a href=#>review of the Audeze LCD-5</a> here) headphones (note, I tested using a 6.35-3.5mm converter). These are truly flagship cans, and they're planar magnetic, so the response is excellent across all frequency ranges. Initially, I was sat disappointed, wondering by the iFi Hip-DAC2 wouldn't drive these headphones until I realized some idiot that definitely isn't me had turned the volume on my smartphone right down.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Buffoonery out of the way, and I was soon nodding my head to perfectly recreated and represented sound. The Hip-DAC2 was more than enough to power the Audeze LCD-5 (which actually have a very low impedance anyway), and the two worked in wondrous harmony with one another, the Hip-DAC2 delivering detailed sound with fantastic response, which the Audeze LCD-5 setting that soundstage out before my ears. The pairing sounds sublime, to say the least.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Where the Hip-DAC 2 came into play here was, again, adding some oomph to the bass. The Audeze LCD-5 are open back, so you can image that at lower volumes the bass can need a little extra to truly have the impact it deserves. Not with all songs, mind. Anyway, the Hip-DAC2 brought the bass right forward, without making the rest of the frequencies sound muddy or overcome.</p><p>In all, the Hip-DAC2 has no issue at all delivering audiophile-quality sound, which should satisfy even the most critical of audio snobs, particularly at this price. You're unlikely to find a better-sounding portable DAC at this price point, on the current market. I literally have nothing bad to say about this DAC/amp.</p><h2 id=recommending-the-ifi-hip-dac2>Recommending the iFi Hip-DAC2</h2><p>I would recommend iFi's funny-shaped little DAC without hesitation. It is a beautiful device, with excellent craftsmanship, sturdy build quality, and excellent features. Sound-wise, at this price point, you are absolutely onto a winner. I am literally unable to find fault with the Hip-DAC2 aside from the slightly long cables, so I have no qualms giving this device a perfect score.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether you are looking for an inexpensive portable DAC that can truly deliver on its Hi-Res Audio certification, or you're looking to swap your existing DAC for a new one, the Hip-DAC2 should be at the top of your list. Plug any pair of headphones into this pocket rocket and your ears are in for the time of their lives. In short, for $189, this definitely a DAC you want on your person at all times.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGign6FdnbaxecOammZqXaeyt7XEsGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
