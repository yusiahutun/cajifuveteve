Since then, they have welcomed two children into their lives. Their first son Elijah was born on the 26th of Feb, 2019. Elijah is currently two years old and is happy to have company with his baby brother. The couple shares a joint <a href=#>Instagram account</a> which has 193k followers in 2021. They made the announcement of their second child through their social media.</p><p>The couple is obsessed with each other. However, their relationship has had its share of ups and downs. When Rhain legally changed her name from Ruth to Rhain, the Brown family was strictly against it. This is because Noah had a sister named Rhain who passed away. The family felt as if Rhain was trying to steal her name. They even denied her the family name. However, Noah stood up for his wife. He mentioned in an interview that he is proud of his wife, who shares his family name. Noah further added that Rhain is a loving wife and a perfect mother to his children.</p><h2>Noah and Rhain Children</h2><p>Noah and Rhain share two children as of 2021. Their first child is their son Elijah who was born in 2019. Elijah is currently two years old. The couple welcomed a second son on October 10, 2021. They named the baby Adam Brown and occasionally shared pictures of the babies on their joint Instagram handle.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-5426 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famous-celebrities.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Noah-Brown-Rhain-and-son-1012x1024.jpg alt="Image of Noah Brown, Rhain and son" width=1012 height=1024 sizes="(max-width: 1012px) 100vw, 1012px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-5426 class=wp-caption-text>Alaskan Bush People Noah Brown, his wife, Rhain, and son</p><p>In <a href=#>this post</a>, we can see the picture of Elijah cuddling with his baby brother Adam.
