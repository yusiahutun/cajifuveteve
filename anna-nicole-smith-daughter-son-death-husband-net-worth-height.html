Anna’s life is a story of humble beginnings that soon shot into life in the fast lane; drugs, fame, wild parties, body enlargements – all wrong.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Anna Nicole Smith Bio</strong></h2><p>Anna was born on 28 November 1967, but unfortunately died on 8 February 2007, and was an American actress and model. She first came on the scene when she became famous in Playboy and won the 1993 Playmate of the Year.</p><p>She was born in Houston, Texas. Her father is Donald Eugene Hogan and her mother Virgie Mae Arthur. She attended Durkee Elementary School and later attended Aldine Senior High School in Houston. Anna was not suited for the classroom, she failed the first year, and in the second year, she dropped out of school at the age of 14. She took a job as a waitress in a fried chicken restaurant, where she met and married Billy Wayne Smith, who was the chef in the restaurant. She was barely 18 years old when she married Billy and only one year after their marriage on January 22, 1986, she gave birth to her son Daniel Smith.</p><p>It was her second marriage that gained great publicity. At 26, she married the 89-year-old billionaire J. Howard Marshall, whom she had met while stripping. The mogul died after only 13 months of marriage, and interestingly, he didn’t mention Smith in his will. Anna sued for half of her late husband’s $1.6 billion estates, a lawsuit that lasted another 11 years.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Eddie Murphy Children, Wife, Brother, Girlfriend, Gay, Height, Is He Dead?</a></strong></p><p>The big breakthrough for Anna Nicole Smith came when she was the cover of Playboy in 1993 and was also named Playmate of the Year by Hugh Heffner in 1993.</p><p>Smith secured a contract to replace supermodel Claudia Schiffer in a Guess jeans campaign.

Anna Nicole Smith got her first leading role in “To the Limit” where she played Colette Dubois, a retired spy who wants to take revenge on the murderer of her late husband.</p><p>Later in her life, in 2011, after her breast implant ruptured one of her nipples, she took painkillers again.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Anna Nicole Smith owed most of her wealth to her marriage to the oil business mogul J. Howard Marshal. When Marshal was alive, he spent a lot of money on Anna. At the time of her death, her estimated net worth was about $50 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Body Measurements, Height</strong></h2><p>Throughout her life, Anna’s strongest quality was her sex appeal, and she weighed about 125 pounds. Her life expectancy was 36-28-38 pounds.

Stern, Larry Birkhead (Anna’s photographer), Alexander Denk, (Anna’s bodyguard) Frederic von Anhalt, husband of the actress Zsa Zsa Gabor, all claimed the paternity of Dannielynn.</p><p>Anna herself had named Howard K. Stern as the father in her daughter’s birth certificate. After a DNA test, Larry Birkhead was formally identified as the father of Dannielynn.
