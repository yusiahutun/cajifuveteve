Among them, how many are willing to have children? How many are fundamentally unwilling to do so? And how many fall somewhere in between?” the person said, urging detailed research be undertaken in advance of government action.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The analyst called attention to China’s traditional emphasis on childbirth within marriage, and pointed out that relaxing policies concerning extramarital reproduction, such as sperm donation and surrogacy, could have unforeseeable effects on social stability.</p>In addition, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">prolonged maternity leave</span></a> – a popular suggestion to address China’s declining fertility – could also have a downside, the person said. Extended leave could potentially undermine female workers’ competitiveness in the job market, burdening them further and compounding their already strong reluctance to let childbirth jeopardise their careers.<figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">The challenge of low fertility rates needs to be addressed systematically and requires more than piecemeal solutionsHe Dan, China Population and Development Research Centre</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hiring foreign nannies who lack proficiency in Chinese is also a “fanciful idea,” the expert said, as many young couples in China “wouldn’t dare entrust their children to their own parents” due to the meticulous standards they hold.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Chinese treat their children as if they were delicate Rolex timepieces, thus it is unrealistic to expect them to switch to the standards for an electronic watch that costs around 10 yuan.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The presence of foreign labourers could also give rise to social problems in terms of cultural differences, the person added, and sending them away would be much more difficult than hiring them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He Dan, director of the China Population and Development Research Centre, a think tank affiliated with the National Health Commission, said there is an urgent need for a shift in mindset and institutional breakthroughs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Overall, the challenge of low fertility rates needs to be addressed systematically and requires more than piecemeal solutions,” she wrote in an article published in the December issue of the commission’s Population and Health magazine.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“China’s fertility support policies need to find a convergence point between economic development and social progress, and establish a connection between social welfare and social investment.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Li Ting, a professor of population with Renmin University, argued that giving out money might provide a boost to births in the short term, but will not be sustainable in the long run.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I don’t think [institutions] are willing to allocate such a significant amount [to boosting births],”she said.</p>“East Asian countries have been providing support for childbirth for many years, but the effects have not been substantial.
