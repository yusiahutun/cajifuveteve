Marie spent her elementary and high school years in Jackson and Greenville, where she was very active in her church and in musical groups. During high school, Marie hosted a radio program, “Marie Stokes Sings,” which opened each week with her singing “With a Song in My Heart.” These early experiences formed a springboard for Marie’s lifelong love of singing and sharing her beautiful soprano voice with others.

She transferred to Ole Miss, where she was active in the University Chorus, Girls Glee Club and Chi Omega. Most significantly at Ole Miss, Marie met her beloved husband of 68 years George Melichar. After graduation from Ole Miss with an education degree and then marriage, Marie and George moved to San Diego for George’s naval duty; then they settled in Laurel. Marie was a loving and caring mother to their two daughters and was a devoted and supportive wife. She also volunteered for numerous church and civic activities.</p><p>Marie’s real passion throughout her life involved giving her time and musical talent to others in order to glorify the Lord. As a church choir member her entire life, Marie faithfully attended weekly choir practices and sang in church services well past 90 years of age!

Marie had leading roles in many Laurel Little Theatre musicals and she was a frequently requested soloist for numerous weddings, programs, churches, clubs and conventions.</p><p>A member of Laurel First United Methodist Church for 70 years, Marie also served on the administrative board and the UMW. She was children’s choir director, Sunday school music coordinator and church historian. Marie loved being a member of DAR, Laurel Junior Auxiliary and Laurel Little Garden Club.</p><p>Marie cherished the time spent with her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.&nbsp; She was very gregarious and loved talking and visiting with everyone. In addition, she wrote poems and songs, cheered for her Ole Miss Rebels, shared and catalogued her family’s genealogy, and was ever proud to show her patriotism. She fiercely loved God, her family and her country.</p><p>She was preceded in death by her husband George I. Melichar; her parents Mr. and Mrs. Walter E. Stokes Jr.; and her brother Walter E. Stokes III.&nbsp;</p><p>Marie is survived by her daughters Marcia (Steve) Whatley of Madison and Leah (Glenn) Campbell of Hattiesburg; grandchildren Steven (Rebecca) Whatley, Jennifer (Jake) Vaughn, Michael Campbell and Chris (Caitlin) Campbell; and great-grandchildren Hank, Joey Grace and Lucy Vaughn, and Logan Whatley. &nbsp;</p><p>The family expresses a special thank you for the care, concern and compassion shown to Marie by the staff at the Arbor during her later years there as a resident.</p><p>A service of remembrance and resurrection will be Tuesday, Oct. 17, at 11 a.m. at Laurel First United Methodist Church.
