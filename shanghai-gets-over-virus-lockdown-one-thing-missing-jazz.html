We were all getting increasingly concerned about the situation there and also worried about ourselves. In my whole 28-year lifetime, I have never heard of [such] measures by the government, such as closing down the whole city. We immediately realised this time was really serious.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">A 97-year-old trumpeter?

It happened on January 23, the same day that Wuhan was sealed off.”<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jazz at Lincoln Centre Shanghai and Blue Note China also closed as the situation’s gravity became apparent. So, how have Shanghai’s jazz musicians survived?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The impact of Covid-19 on [the] jazz scene in Shanghai and China is very direct,” said Hu. “Musicians lost their gigs … so many of them have regular students, and some are on the faculty of conservatories. So economically, most of our jazz musicians – which were active on the scene before the pandemic – don’t have to ‘starve’. But it definitely curbs their income.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“And Chinese jazz musicians are mostly young. Many of them were born in [the] late ’80s and ’90s and [are] currently based in Beijing or Shanghai, away from [Wuhan]. I haven’t heard of any jazz musician being infected.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/04/17/eb3d3388-7f9b-11ea-8736-98edddd9b5ca_972x_154320.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For, just as in the United States and elsewhere, life in China has been dramatically reordered.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’ve found that different provinces actually dealt with this issue differently, even back in the peak period,” said Hu.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But Shanghai actually was … one of the province-level administrations that had the most loose policy. We were not banned from going out, but the government repeatedly advocated us to [stay inside].</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If you go out any time during the day, there wouldn’t be any punishment actually. But everyone self-consciously wears a mask, even till today. And it’s also true that the city was almost emptied, for there literally was almost no one on the street.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/04/17/654ab9b2-8063-11ea-8736-98edddd9b5ca_972x_154320.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The quarantine in China has been lifted, said Hu, with Wuhan having reopened on April 8. Most other provinces ended their quarantines in February and March, she added.</p>A new kind of life is emerging, its gradual nature perhaps foreshadowing how the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">US might gingerly rebuild after the pandemic</span></a>. “Recently, we are slowly getting back to normal,” she said. “The subway is getting crowded again – still less than before the pandemic.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Resumptions are taking place in the restaurant industry too. The authorities have issued resumption guidelines for different sectors. For example, certain limit of people sitting [at] one table, the mask rules, temperature checks at the entrances and so on.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In Shanghai, we are basically able to do a lot actually, especially since the resumption in February. Everything is ‘almost’ getting back to normalcy. For me, the absence of concerts, and actually the whole entertainment activities, is the only thing that I don’t feel like getting back to normal.”</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">I love jazz almost as an aficionado, so this fondness for writing – almost exclusively on jazz – just happens naturallyHu Jiaowei, Shanghai jazz writer</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hu said she became interested in jazz about a decade ago when she heard “Jasmine”, a 2010 album by Keith Jarrett and Charlie Haden. That drew her into the music, a bit of a leap from the classical piano training she had since childhood.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But jazz spoke to her in a way that no other music did. “It’s not just the freedom that I’ve been so much attracted to,” she said. “The diversity it has to offer is even enlightening to me.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Back then, jazz was definitely not a mainstream music type in China – it still isn’t. You had to learn about the music by yourself, because there was very little possibility that someone was going to promote the genre to you, unlike our increasing jazz venues today.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/04/17/5aac0902-8063-11ea-8736-98edddd9b5ca_972x_154320.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yet Hu persevered, building her knowledge of the music and later deciding to write about it as “a way to express the listener’s feelings and understanding of music. I love jazz almost as an aficionado, so this fondness for writing – almost exclusively on jazz – just happens naturally.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That she does so in both English and Chinese attests to her potential as a bridge between two cultures.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And what of the future of jazz in Shanghai?</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong Jazz Legend Elisa Chan Kit-ling: 'Why Would I Give Up Music?'</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Most of us are still uncertain of what ‘future’ means at this moment,” said Hu. “How far is this ‘future’ away from us now?
