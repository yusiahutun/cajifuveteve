One girl even chased Anastasiya down the school corridor with a knife, threatening to cut off her breasts.</p><p>The trauma reached its climax when a male student, angered by Anastasiya's rejection of his constant advances, spread false rumours about her, saying she had a foursome with him and his friends in the school bathroom.</p><p>"I was a virgin at that time, and I was so upset and embarrassed by what he had told everyone about me," she added. "At that moment, I felt destroyed and dirty. It led me to a horrible depression."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31055374.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/1_model_main.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>The mounting pressure and emotional turmoil forced Anastasiya to leave a traditional school altogether, and she finished her education at home. For three years, she was homeschooled, often locking herself in her room, playing video games and engaging with friends only through online games. She didn't even go to prom.</p><p>"I was lonely growing up, but that changed when I discovered communities of women on social media who were celebrating their diverse body types," she said. "Their stories helped me see my own beauty and my own worth."</p><p>Inspired by the self-confidence of others, Anastasiya, who worked as a graphic designer and content writer before becoming a model, began chronicling her journey on social media as well.</p><p>"I started my Instagram page in 2018 as a professional account for my artwork but then began uploading pictures of me in swimwear," she commented. "The images attracted the attention of influencers, who reposted my pictures.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31061534.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_Anastasiya-Berthier-Im-a-natural-34KK.jpg><p>"My page started to grow fast, gaining more than 510,000 followers in just two years. Instagram blocked my main account for six months, so I created a new one. It did even better than the first."</p><p>Now boasting more than 1.7million followers on Instagram, Anastasiya has transformed a "flaw" into her biggest asset. Her account offers a blend of stunning photographs and creative narratives.</p><p>Far from being reserved, she wholeheartedly embraces the lighthearted quirks associated with her chest size, frequently infusing humour into her posts.</p><p>While Anastasiya loves engaging her followers with lighthearted content, she doesn't shy away from addressing weightier topics like cyberbullying and its real-life repercussions.</p><p>She said: "While most of my followers are supportive, I still get negative comments and experience slut-shaming. Trolls hide behind the anonymity of the internet and fake accounts and continue to harass me, always trying to give their opinion or even create forums to talk about my personal life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31061540.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Anastasiya-Berthier-Im-a-natural-34KK.jpg><p><b><i>Get all the biggest Lifestyle news straight to your inbox. <a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Sign up for the free Daily Star Hot Topics newsletter</a>.</i></b></p><p>"But instead of getting upset, I use their comments as a talking point to address the impact of cyberbullying and the role it can play in mental health issues and suicidal thoughts. I don't let comments get me down. I am proud of who I am. I love myself and my body. I love my curves. I love the volume of my chest, my hips and my waist."</p><p>With each photograph, post, and story she shares, Anastasiya reiterates a crucial message: Embrace Mother Nature's gifts and love yourself unconditionally.</p><p><i><b>For emotional support you can call the Samaritans 24-hour helpline on 116 123, email jo@samaritans.org, visit a Samaritans branch in person or go to the Samaritans website.</b></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKqVlrluuMifnGisoqS5rb%2BMrqqenF2ivKS3jJugoGWSpLyjv4xsaGluYGl%2Fdw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
