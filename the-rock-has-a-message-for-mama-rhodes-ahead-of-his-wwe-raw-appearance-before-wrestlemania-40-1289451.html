The Rock has made pro wrestling unpredictable and he’s changed the game and raised the bar - again. The Rock is THE most electric, disruptive, distinctive, and hottest heel professional wrestling has seen in the last 20 years. You’re Welcome. F*ck off crybabies. Mama Rhodes ~ The Rock has a very special belt being made just for you. Your tears. Cody’s blood. My hands. I’ll see you soon, Mama Rhodes… ~ Final Boss." <a rel=nofollow href=# class="looms--artdiv loomsart--logodiv loomsart--logodiv-v2" onclick='trigger17LoomsEntryClick("17Looms_AP_Logo","-","-","-")'><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/images/17looms_pinkvilla_deshtop_article_entry_updated.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>In the past Monday Night on RAW, Cody Rhodes had however, negated The Rock’s theory that she would be afraid to see him at WrestleMania 40, and instead recounted a story when his mom had beaten up an undercover cop while at a Willie Nelson concert.&nbsp;</p><br><br><br><h2 id=66020c0b0ae44>Will there be The Rock vs Cody Rhodes in future?</h2><p>Going by the storyline, that has been built so far, it appears that The Rock and Cody Rhodes will battle it out somewhere down the line in WWE. And by all chance, the Tag Team match with Roman Reigns will also not be The Rock’s final match in WWE.</p><p>According to the reports, The Great One has planned for one more match but that is not decided yet. The Rock will go back to complete his Hollywood projects from May till August, and a match could be possible at either Survivor Series or WrestleMania 41.&nbsp;</p><p>For the time being, the fans are extremely excited to witness The Rock go up against Cody Rhodes and Seth Rollins on Night 1 of WrestleMania 40.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGiqqaeiqcBwwMeeZKunk6B6qa3SZphmpZWowKKzxGadqKpdoq6urYyrn6iclah6orTEmptmp5Zitaq%2FjLCunmWilsRurc%2BpnJqqkaOwpnnBnp2oqpVixLOx0q2jnqWRo7aieZNpZGpqaG6Bdn0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
