Pass. The “Millionaire Matchmaker” isn’t going to be your first source for no-fail dating wisdom.</p><p>So, when the opportunity arose to chat with Patti—she’s the <a href=# rel=nofollow>completely bare</a> ambassador—we didn’t think we’d come away from it with a ton of practical, or at least any especially empowering, womanly advice. We’re not going to follow everything she says to the grave, but Patti shockingly did have a few opinions that didn’t strike us as being downright ridiculous. Follow what you will below.</p><p><strong>1. You should address the hair downstairs.<br></strong>“If you do get loosie goosie maybe you can see three, four dates in if he’s committed to you, you want to be able to be clean downstairs and use all the different techniques. And some people like to shave so we [completely bare] have gels for that, but other people like to just wax. When you clean yourself up, you want to feel sexy. That’s the key. You want to feel sexy on the date. You’re not selling a business deal, you’re selling yourself. And if you don’t feel like you’re hot because you’re not groomed right, you’re not gonna get the guy. And that’s just the way it is.”</p><p><strong>2. Less is more when it comes to makeup. Oh, and channel Jennifer Aniston.</strong><br>“I think eyeliner is key, a little mascara, a little lip balm, and definitely break out the contour. A little rouge. Less is more. Step away from cake face. They [men] don’t like cake face. They should think you just woke up this way, as<strong> Beyonce</strong> says or had a little summer glow from the beach. You want to look like Jennifer Aniston—[she] would be a picture perfect girl, because she doesn’t look like she’s overdone. She’s probably the #1 request we get. She’ll age to be 60 and they’ll still say her name.”</p><p><strong>3. Skip the bold lipstick.</strong><br>“No red, no fuchsias. Light lip gloss. Because you want him to kiss you, and he doesn’t want to touch you if you’re too sticky. I’m a big fan of pink golds from Bobbi Brown—that is my go-to. That has never left me. If she ever discontinues that color, I’ll probably commit suicide. You need to know what your color is.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/patti.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/VOS-Body.jpeg><p><strong>MORE: <a href=#>First Date Makeup That Will Get a Second Date</a></strong></p><p><strong>4. Keep your sleepover bag well-stocked with stuff that smells good.</strong><br>“Well the first thing I think you would need is definitely deodorant. A good smell does a lot. My mother used to spray the pillow with her favorite fragrance so when she left the next night he would go to bed and smell her. I’m all about fragrance. Body lotion. Deodorant. Anything that smells great. The folks over at Perfumania—they have amazing brands. And you need to find your signature scent. Studies have shown that vanilla and pumpkin spice are the number 1 kind of attractors for men to be drawn to you, so keep that in mind.”</p><p><strong>5. But, also stock a quick hair removal solution</strong> <strong>for your legs and under your arms.<br></strong>“The other thing is you want to be able to just fit a cleanser in. You know, I know me. I can get stubble in a day because I’m dark. So I might take my shower and <a href=# rel=nofollow>completely bare</a> and shave my legs in the shower because then I run back into bed and who knows maybe it’s going to last long and we’re gonna have a second time around the lamppost so to speak.”</p><p><strong>6.</strong> <strong>And, this is how Patti says to get through no sex on the first date.<br></strong>“It’s funny because if I grow a bush down there, I ain’t giving it away. So it’s kind of like in one way it works for you if you’re going to hold onto it. But I have a better idea. Get clean and then take your vibrator out. I’m a big fan of Layla Vibrators. They’re high end—you know real amazing vibrators that are $200, $300. They last forever. You can take them in the car and use the USB and charge in traffic. And take the edge off. It’s like a cocktail. And then you won’t be in heat, so you’ll still look clean but you’re not gonna give it away first off.”</p><p><strong>7. Try to match your guy’s outfit on the first date. If he’s wearing jeans, do the same.</strong><br>“It’s called mirroring. Mirrored couples are more likely to get into a serious relationship than non-mirrored couples.”</p><p><strong>8. Patti says the “best-kept Hollywood Secret” is to shave your face.</strong><br>“Face shaving is not going to happen all the time. Once every 6 weeks. You don’t need it that often because it’s not that kind of hair. You should do it. Your makeup will look better and your friends are going to notice your skin is radiant.”</p><p><strong>MORE: <a href=#>8 Beauty Rules That Were Made for Breaking</a></strong></p><p><strong>9. Dress for your age and your body type.<br></strong>“<strong>Olivia Palermo</strong> is one of my style icons. But can I wear her stuff? I have tits. I have a 34 DD natural boob, so I can’t pull off a lot of her stuff. So if you’re going to try to do the <strong>Gigi Hadid</strong> or the Olivia Palermo or the <strong>Kendall Jenner—</strong>they are 20-something and you’re 45? Don’t do it. It’s when a woman looks too young. We all notice when Kris [Jenner] is trying to dress like her kids. Stop it. Stop the madness.”</p><p><strong>10. When it comes to your hair, there aren’t any rules.<br></strong>“It’s different strokes for different folks. Some men like curly hair, some men like straight hair. Millionaire men like straight hair. They like flat-ironed, silky, Asian-looking hair. So it depends. Certain men don’t care about extensions. Other men hate it. They want to put their hands in your hair.”</p><p><strong>11. Apparently guys don’t get patterns.<br>“</strong>Men hate patterns. They usually tend to gravitate to dark colors and red. Solid colors. They don’t like the bright neons they don’t like the patterns. They think it’s too much.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLqit8Sup2hsZm6Gdn2OqZitrJliwLWtzaCcq2WSmq62wNhmq6Koo2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
