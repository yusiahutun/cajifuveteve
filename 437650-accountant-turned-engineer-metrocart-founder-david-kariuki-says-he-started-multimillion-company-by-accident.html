After that, he would grow on the career ladder and become a managing director of the engineering company.</p>"At that company, I learnt most of the things I needed to know about engineering. So I went and thrived in it."<h2>How he developed an interest in the field</h2><p class=align-left>Apart from the company's daily management that got him interested in the field, Kariuki said a trip to Germany was the ultimate game-changer.</p>"I went to this small village in Germany where everything ran on renewable energy. I had never seen another carbon-neutral place. That gave me an idea of offering these kinds of solutions back home."<p class=align-left>When he returned to Kenya, Kariuki approached his boss to localise the idea, but he did not buy it.</p>"I challenged myself to venture into the business and decided to quit formal employment," he said. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/65e9fb8b1d8a4139.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Outspoken Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter Graduates with Master's Degree 5 Years Later</span></p></a><p class=align-left>With a starting capital of KSh 3.8 million, Kariuki started Metrocart, a company that is today valued at KSh 200 million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e39e3901e92d62c1.jpg><h2>How he grew the business</h2><p class=align-left>Kariuki emphasised the power of networking, saying that indeed, 'your network is your net worth'.</p><p class=align-left>After getting into the grind and getting his initial contracts, Kariuki said he started getting referrals, which remain his most prominent source of clients to date.</p>"People within my network started telling others about the work that Metrocart was doing. In no time, we were able to get more customers," he said.<p class=align-left>Since its launch, Kariuki disclosed that the company has installed over 5 megawatts (MW) of solar power across Kenya with over 10,000 litres in installed capacity for solar water heating.</p><p class=align-left>The company is also thriving in integrating technologies and expertise across the entire solar value chain to deliver energy solutions that maximise value while minimising their risk.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/65ddfbded733cba9.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Cape Coast Technical University Builds First-Ever Solar-Powered Tuk-Tuk</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Kariuki revealed that the company imports components needed to assemble the solutions from Europe and China.</p><p class=align-left>Questioned about recurring challenges while running a renewable energy company, Kariuki lists unpredictable policies and dealing with counterfeits as the most persistent problems.</p>"Policies surrounding renewable energy in Kenya are not standard, neither are they reliable. This makes working in this field very challenging as you do not know what will happen next," he said.<p class=align-left>Kariuki added that selling quality products in a market filled with counterfeit products is also a considerable challenge.</p>"For instance, since the use of renewable energy products is still new, people do not know how to identify quality products. The counterfeit ones are flooding the market and are cheaper because the sellers do not tell their customers the truth," he said.<p class=align-left>He added that most second-hand renewable solutions available in the market are usually nearing their expiration dates and will cause problems to the environment when disposing of them in the long term.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/02529d0e3b79fca6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Man Builds ‘Wheelbarrow’ That Can Serve As 4 Shops at Same Time, Stuns Many With His Creativity</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Looking into the future, Kariuki said he looks forward to when the government will have formulated policies that look out for the ordinary citizen and protect the environment.</p><p class=align-left>Asked about this advice for people getting into <a href=#>business</a>, Kariuki says offering practical solutions to practical problems is the way to go.</p>"Ensure you are solving an ongoing challenge, then solve that problem with excellence. That will surely grow whatever venture you are starting," he said in conclusion.<p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnCu1Kygp52jqHqmr86npqaxX567pcHSramyZ2RohHeBj2aYnJufqru1rc2tZK2toqOypXnEp56ippWav265xK2pqJuRp8Fuss6upZ2domKxosLInWSkmaKewqy1jKyYsqtdnbJuv9Oaqa2dlGK6trjToqSipJyevK95wqikqZmernqjxYyampyhlJq7tXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
