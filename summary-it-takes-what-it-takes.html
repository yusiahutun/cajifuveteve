The good news is that there’s a way of thinking that equips you to face these moments with a clear head and a steady heart. In this summary, you’ll embark on a journey that unveils the concept of neutral thinking. It’s a mindset used by some of the world’s most accomplished individuals – from professional football players to astronauts.</p><p>This exploration isn’t just about them – it’s about you. By understanding and embracing neutral thinking, you’ll be better positioned to handle life’s challenges. But embracing this concept isn’t merely about reducing negative self-talk or avoiding pessimism. It’s about understanding your emotions, acknowledging them, and then choosing a path that isn’t clouded by them. Whether you’re confronting personal dilemmas or professional challenges, this mindset will empower you to forge ahead with resilience and determination.</p><h2><span id=The_power_of_neutral_thinking>The power of neutral thinking</span></h2><p>Do you remember the last time life caught you off guard? Perhaps you became emotional, reactive, or even judgmental. What if there were a way to navigate these situations with more clarity and less emotional baggage? Enter the concept of neutral thinking – a mindset free from biases and judgments.</p><p>Imagine you’re Russell Wilson, one of the NFL’s top-tier players. Picture a crucial playoff game. The stakes are high, the pressure is mounting – and then, suddenly, you throw multiple interceptions. The crowd gasps and the weight of the world is on your shoulders. But instead of spiraling into negative self-talk or becoming paralyzed by fear, you reset. This reset doesn’t mean you ignore the mistakes or brush them under the rug. Rather, you acknowledge them, and you understand that the past can’t be changed. But the next move, the next pass, the next decision – that’s entirely up to you.</p><p>Russell embodies this art of neutral thinking. No matter the turbulence of the past season or personal challenges, he kept his eyes on the present moment, understanding that dwelling in the past or worrying about the future doesn’t serve his current game. It’s a mindset that acknowledges reality but doesn’t let emotions dictate the course of action.</p><p>Here’s another example: astronauts are masters of neutral thinking, too. Remember those famous words “Houston, we’ve had a problem”? Well, on April 14, 1970, the crew of Apollo 13 did have a problem. During the mission, an accident occurred in one of the service module’s oxygen tanks, compromising the spacecraft’s sources of power and oxygen. Stranded in space, facing dire circumstances, panic and despair could have easily taken over. But these astronauts, along with their ground-control team, exemplified the art of how to stay calm and practice neutral thinking. They tackled one problem at a time, acknowledging the severity of the situation, but not letting emotions cloud their judgment. This mindset allowed them to ingeniously craft solutions on the fly, ultimately saving their lives and ensuring a triumphant return to Earth.</p><p>So how can you apply their wisdom to your daily life? First, understand that emotions aren’t your enemies. They’re signals, indicators of something deeper. Neutral thinking isn’t about burying those emotions – it’s about recognizing them and not letting them drive the car. To help yourself in these situations, pause and take three deep breaths before reacting. This simple act can help shift your perspective from emotional to neutral, allowing for clearer decision-making.</p><p>Secondly, it’s vital to remember that every moment offers a new choice. No, you can’t change what happened five minutes ago, but you’re in full control of the next five minutes. Whether you’re gearing up for a big presentation, navigating personal relationships, or just deciding what to eat for dinner, taking a neutral stance can make the decision clearer and less fraught with unnecessary baggage.</p><p>In essence, neutral thinking is your compass in the stormy seas of life. Embrace it, practice it, and watch as you navigate challenges with newfound clarity and purpose.</p><h2><span id=How_to_make_a_detailed_plan>How to make a detailed plan</span></h2><p>Imagine the sheer determination and vision it takes for an athlete to <a href=#>bounce back</a> from a devastating Super Bowl loss, or the grit required to play an entire rigorous NFL season. These aren’t mere whimsical dreams. They stem from detailed plans – a powerful combination of mental conditioning, visualization, and, of course, neutral thinking.</p><p>Picture this: Russell Wilson, after that Super Bowl setback, didn’t wallow in despair. Instead, he constructed a meticulous off-season plan, a roadmap to self-improvement, both mentally and physically. Or consider Fred Taylor, aspiring to play a full NFL season without injuries. He wasn’t relying on hope or sheer willpower – he had a concrete plan in place.</p><p>But life, as you know, is ever-evolving. Just like a coach adjusting a game plan when facing unexpected defenses, our plans need flexibility. Consider the big goals you’ve set for yourself. While the destination is crucial, the journey is filled with small, actionable steps, each echoing your commitment. Take a moment to pinpoint three behaviors that can inch you closer to your aspirations. Instead of vague resolutions, let’s make them tangible and present. Say, “I run every morning,” or “I dedicate 30 minutes to reading before sleep.” Your daily actions, much like a player’s moves on the field, define your progress, and help bring those dreams into the endzone of reality.</p><p>Visualization is another potent tool. Remember Michael Johnson, the Olympic sprinter? His decision to don those gold shoes in the 1996 Olympics was more than a fashion statement. It was a symbol of his unwavering belief in victory, reinforced by repetitive visualization exercises that mentally prepped him for success on the track. Let this serve as a reminder that our minds often struggle to differentiate between vividly imagined scenarios and reality. This isn’t about daydreaming; it’s structured imagery. So, next time you’re preparing for a challenge, dedicate some quiet moments to picturing the steps, not just the outcome, leading you to success.</p><h2><span id=Controlling_your_influences_and_environment>Controlling your influences and environment</span></h2><p>Every one of us is influenced by the world around us, whether we realize it or not. From the tunes that play through our headphones to the daily news we consume, even down to the people we interact with – all of these contribute to our mindset and, ultimately, our performance in life. Imagine if you could take control of these influences, actively steering your mind away from negativity and toward a more neutral, focused state.</p><p>Consider a practical experiment called the negativity diet. It’s a simple but transformative concept. Instead of indulging in a barrage of pessimistic news or surrounding oneself with constant naysayers, one proactively limits these “inputs,” replacing them with neutral or positive ones. The results? A significant improvement in mindset and overall mental well-being.</p><p>Now, let’s zoom in on a more specific scenario to truly understand the profound impact of this. Imagine Sarah, a talented professional who feels bogged down by her high-pressure job and the constant noise from her social media. Overwhelmed, she decides to embark on a two-week negativity diet. She cuts down on her news consumption, focusing only on essential updates, and replaces her playlist with uplifting or neutral tunes. She also makes a conscious effort to spend more time with supportive friends and less time on social media platforms that drain her energy. After just a fortnight, Sarah finds herself more focused, less anxious, and overall more productive in her job. She’s effectively curated her environment, taking charge of the influences that shape her daily life.</p><p>So what can you take from all this? First, make a conscious decision about what you let into your mind. It might be as simple as changing your morning routine, swapping that habit of scrolling through negative news stories with a podcast that educates or inspires. Secondly, evaluate your circle. Are the people around you uplifting and supportive, or are they adding to the noise and chaos? Remember, you have the power to choose whom you spend your time with and what influences you allow in your space.</p><p>In a world where pressures are real and sometimes intense, remember that these pressures can also be catalysts for growth. Take a lesson from those who have faced immense pressure in different situations, whether it be from unexpected job loss or an athlete under scrutiny on the world stage. These moments, though difficult, often push us to reach out, to take bold steps, to evolve. Steering into the pressure, rather than away from it, becomes a path to a greater version of ourselves. And on the other side of that pressure is triumph, a feeling so profound and rewarding that it’s worth every ounce of effort.</p><h2><span id=Role_models_and_leadership>Role models and leadership</span></h2><p>In moments of reflection, we often find ourselves turning to figures we’ve admired, whether in the realms of sports, education, or entertainment, or within the sanctity of our own homes. Role models, as central figures in our lives, illuminate the path to success with their actions and choices. Let’s again look at Russell Wilson, the Super Bowl-winning quarterback. While many might envision him as a powerhouse on the field, it was the behaviors and qualities of Derek Jeter, a figure he looked up to, that steered him. Wilson wasn’t just inspired by celebrity figures, but was equally touched by the everyday heroics of his father, Harrison Wilson III. This two-sport star and accomplished lawyer was a beacon for Russell, exemplifying how figures close to us often cast the most influential shadows.</p><p>Similarly, the author shares a poignant story about his father, Bob. Bob Moawad wasn’t just an educator but also a fervent believer in the potency of attitude. Even amid skeptics, he held the torch high, emphasizing that our attitudes not only shape our perspectives but can profoundly affect outcomes. Bob Moawad’s journey, transitioning from teaching to motivational speaking, stands as a testament that authentic belief and positive thinking can indeed bring transformative shifts in individuals’ lives.</p><p>But role models don’t just lead by explicit instruction. Their actions, often silent yet deliberate, set the stage for those watching. When Trevor was a teacher in Los Angeles, a student frequently greeted him smilingly, even though he wasn’t even part of one of his classes. Trevor always returned the greeting. One day, he received a letter in which the student thanked him wholeheartedly, saying that Trevor’s simple “hellos” had meant the world to him. This reaffirms a pivotal point: sometimes, the most profound impact we have is in the silent footprints of our actions, even when we’re unaware of being observed.</p><p>So, as you find yourself amid life’s ebbs and flows, remember the invaluable lessons imprinted by those we look up to. Channel their wisdom, honor their legacy, and above all, recognize the profound power of choice. As you stand at life’s crossroads, let your actions, driven by neutral thinking, carve the way. And in doing so, remember that the true essence of living neutral is to perceive life’s events, both highs and lows, as steps in a continual journey – not an ending.</p><h2><span id=Summary>Summary</span></h2><h3>NFL star Russell Wilson embodies the tenets of neutral thinking.</h3><p>Russell Wilson, the quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks, illustrated the neutral thinking mind-set during the US National Football Conference championship in January 2015. Wilson played poorly for most of the game, throwing four interceptions. With five minutes left, the Seahawks were losing 19-7. Wilson never gave up. He ignored his mistakes, yelling to teammates, “We can still win this game! Let’s go!”</p><p>Wilson was a student of neutral thinking, a strategy that trains its adherents to tune out past mistakes and fend off the deflating negative thinking that follows. Wilson could have fallen into an emotional trap. Off the field, he was getting divorced. On the field, his four tactical choices had been disastrous. He could have caved into negative thoughts and decided this wasn’t his day so he’d wait until next year. Instead, he stayed neutral, ignored his disappointment and focused on his task: Some time remained on the clock, and his team needed two scores.</p><p>“Neutral thinking is the key to unlocking a set of behaviors that can turn also-rans into champions and champions into legends.”</p><p>Improbably, Wilson led two touchdown drives, and the Seahawks pulled ahead, 22-19. However, the Packers had a star quarterback of their own, and he tied the game at 22. Wilson threw the game-winning touchdown pass in overtime, and the Seahawks won. Later, he described forcing himself to forget about his earlier shaky performance and to think about only one play at a time.</p><h2><span id=Neutral_thinking_teaches_you_to_acknowledge_your_mistakes_and_move_on>Neutral thinking teaches you to acknowledge your mistakes and move on.</span></h2><p>Neutral thinking doesn’t mean that you ignore your missteps. A quarterback shouldn’t pretend he didn’t throw an interception, nor should he repeat his bad decisions. Whether a mistake happens at work or at home, no one benefits from denying reality. However, too many people let disappointments and setbacks consume them to the extent that they can no longer perform. To bounce back, go into neutral thinking. The human brain is much like a car: Your vehicle’s design doesn’t support switching instantly from reverse to forward; it needs a brief pause in neutral to reset.</p><p>“The past isn’t predictive. The past isn’t prologue.”</p><p>University of Southern California quarterback J.T. Daniels experienced this process in 2018. In a game against Stanford, he threw two interceptions and no touchdowns. Daniels made no excuses. A couple of weeks later, he performed flawlessly. Daniels publicly credited neutral thinking.</p><p>When the University of Georgia football team played badly in the first half of a big game, coach Kirby Smart embraced the wisdom of going into neutral. Instead of criticizing his team at halftime, Smart’s locker room speech was straightforward: He told his players to understand that their poor play in the first half didn’t mean their bad performance would continue in the second half. Georgia came back and won in overtime.</p><h2><span id=Neutral_thinking_applies_in_life-and-death_situations>Neutral thinking applies in life-and-death situations.</span></h2><p>Neutral thinking isn’t only for athletes. The Apollo 13 astronauts used clear, calm thinking to survive a potentially disastrous mission. The trio – Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise – were heading toward the moon when an oxygen tank exploded. They had to figure out how they could all stay alive in the lunar landing module – a vehicle safe for only two people. On the ground, NASA engineers scrambled to come up with a workaround that involved rigging filters with cardboard and duct tape. Positive thinking would have doomed them; false confidence wouldn’t have kept three people safe in space. Negative thinking would have been equally disastrous; a skeptical analysis of the engineers’ outlandish plan to save their lives would have wasted precious time.</p><p>“They didn’t worry about the past. They didn’t think about the odds.”</p><p>The astronauts set aside anxiety, doubt and fear. They refrained from judging the wisdom of the engineers’ workaround. Instead, they focused on the moment at hand and tamed their emotions by concentrating on specific behaviors. The astronauts responded with the epitome of neutral thinking – they replaced feelings with action, and they survived.</p><h3>Neutral thinking allows you to accept failure.</h3><p>Wilson won one Super Bowl, but lost another in a heartbreaking last-gasp play. In that game, Wilson threw a final-second pass into the end zone and a defensive player intercepted it. Both at the time and for years afterward, Wilson accepted the defeat gracefully. He could have blamed his coach for calling a questionable play – many fans did, but Wilson gave a steady response to questions. By contrast, when quarterback Cam Newton lost a Super Bowl, his post-game press conference proved decidedly uncomfortable.</p><p>“People aren’t defined by the past unless they choose to live there.”</p><p>Wilson took the high road. His coach accepted responsibility for the Super Bowl loss. Wilson placed the onus on himself. He knew that being a champion meant being in a position to throw a game-winning touchdown. It also required risking a game-losing interception. Wilson accepted the potential risks and the rewards and took pains to keep the setback in perspective. He immediately began working to become an even better athlete.</p><h3>Committing to smart choices is one secret to success.</h3><p>Vince Carter enjoyed a prolonged NBA career, in part because he made choices that allowed him to stay in game shape for years longer than most professional basketball players. He stopped consuming junk food and soda. He started drinking more water and stretching. To preserve his knees, Carter didn’t dunk when a layup would suffice. After games, Carter didn’t party; he worked out. Carter wanted to keep playing, so he made the necessary sacrifices.</p><p>“It takes what it takes.” (Vince Carter)</p><p>When the late author Trevor Moawad spoke to athletes, he would hold a bag of chips in one hand and an apple in the other and ask them if they actually needed a nutritionist to explain which is the healthier choice. Even when the correct choices are clear, making them isn’t always simple.</p><p>An NFL quarterback who flamed out illustrated this reality. Blessed with massive size and a rocket arm, JaMarcus Russell signed a $32 million contract. Yet Russell quickly fell apart. He showed up for his third season overweight and the team that had paid him millions cut him from its roster. After that, he was arrested for illegal possession of codeine. Russell later acknowledged to ESPN that he could have and should have made more productive choices – staying in shape, studying more game films and avoiding bad habits.</p><h3>NFL player Fred Taylor prolonged his career by changing his behaviors.</h3><p>Football star Fred Taylor could have seen his career flame out, too, but he decided to switch his approach. The running back came out of the University of Florida in 1998 as a physical phenom. He was big – 228 pounds – and fast – 4.3 seconds in the 40-yard dash. He received a $5 million signing bonus from the Jacksonville Jaguars. But Taylor’s constant injuries once he was on the team earned him a derisive nickname – “Fragile Fred.” When the Jaguars hired Moawad to work on the mental side of Taylor’s game, the player was reluctant. Taylor felt coach Tom Coughlin had downplayed his latest ailment, a serious groin injury. Since Coughlin had hired Moawad, Taylor didn’t trust him.</p><p>“People can behave themselves into mediocrity. They also can behave themselves out of it.”</p><p>As Moawad gradually earned Taylor’s trust, he learned the running back often stayed out late drinking. Drinking leads to dehydration, which begets minor injuries. Minor soft tissue problems translate to severe injuries, especially for a hard-charging player in a violent sport. Taylor remained in a cycle of undisciplined choices, which led him to feel helpless.</p><p>Moawad told Taylor to emulate longtime NFL players, who often arrive at training facilities before 7.00 a.m. Skeptical, Taylor committed in 2002 to arriving at the Jaguars’ facilities by 6.30 a.m. He spent more time stretching, icing and staying hydrated, and he credits his new routine for enabling him to play 13 NFL seasons.</p><h3>Don’t verbalize worst-case scenarios – they could come true.</h3><p>The human brain stopped evolving in an era when imminent death was a real threat. Today’s world isn’t as physically treacherous, yet the brain remains wired for fear. This survival mechanism explains why apocalyptic scenarios resonate so deeply. To spare yourself needless aggravation, follow one rule to achieve neutral thinking: Don’t say idiotic stuff aloud. By cutting back on expressing negative thoughts, you reduce the caustic emotions that hinder neutral thinking.</p><p>Baseball player Bill Buckner proved this point in 1986. A couple of weeks before the World Series, Buckner told a TV reporter that his nightmare would be to let an opponent win by sending a ground ball between his legs. Just 19 days later, with his Boston Red Sox poised to win the World Series, Buckner let the winning run score on a routine ground ball. Did his fears lead him to crumble when they came true? That’s impossible to prove, but it remains a haunting possibility.</p><p>“I don’t want to play 10 years in the NBA and die of a heart attack at age 40.” (Pete Maravich)</p><p>Basketball star Pete Maravich uttered a similarly prescient thought during a newspaper interview when he said he feared playing out his career and having a coronary at 40. He did, in fact, retire from the NBA after a decade, and he died of a heart attack at 40. Speaking his fear aloud didn’t cause Maravich’s death, but speaking your darkest fears aloud goes give those anxieties power.</p><h3>Olympian Michael Johnson visualized success and planned for it.</h3><p>Before he won two gold medals at the 1996 Olympics, sprinter Michael Johnson suffered several setbacks. He endured a case of food poisoning two weeks before the 1992 Olympics and failed to make the final. Four years later, Johnson made sure his goals were achievable and put in the necessary work. After training for months, Johnson felt sufficiently confident to visualize himself winning the 200- and 400-meter races in the 1996 Olympics.</p><p>“If you can’t run fast, visualizing winning Olympic gold in the 200 meters won’t help you do it.”</p><p>Johnson’s visualizations weren’t mere daydreams or positive thinking. He had done the work, and he had the ability, so imagining a first-place finish was an exercise in neutral thinking. Later, at age 51, Johnson suffered a stroke that threatened his ability to walk. Approaching rehab, Johnson applied the same methodical approach that brought him Olympic glory. By visualizing success and pursuing small gains, he recovered far more quickly than doctors expected.</p><h3>Neutral thinking requires controlling the negativity you consume via the media.</h3><p>Moawad followed what he called the negativity diet. When he was a child, his father enforced rules that included not watching TV news and not listening to country music. And no one in the family could complain or say they couldn’t do something. Not watching the news made sense since television news taps into the human brain’s penchant for unnecessary anxiety, and country music often features downbeat lyrics.</p><p>“Regardless of your political affiliation or channel of choice, the business model of today’s 24-hour news channels is to make you mad, scared or – preferably – both.”</p><p>To test this theory, Moawad decided to go off his negativity diet and spend a month gorging on the mental equivalent of fast food. He watched cable news and listened to heavy metal and country music. The steady diet of depressing fare shook his confidence. He began to feel doubts about himself as a romantic partner and as a businessman. After a time, the emotional melancholy turned physical. He felt ill.</p><p>Moawad tried listening an uplifting Christian rock band, but even that couldn’t lift him from his funk. After days of simmering in negativity, Moawad was exhausted. He had become pessimistic. He canceled medical appointments, fearing doctors would deliver horrible news. He began sending unhinged text messages. At one point, he sobbed uncontrollably.</p><p>To restore his equilibrium, Moawad returned to a more cheerful media diet – fact-based news, lighthearted shows and inspiring music.</p><h2><span id=Conclusion>Conclusion</span></h2><p>Neutral thinking is a strategy for navigating life’s challenges without letting emotions cloud judgment, focusing on the present moment without being held back by past mistakes. Like Russell Wilson’s resilience on the football field or the Apollo 13 astronauts’ problem-solving in space, this mindset acknowledges setbacks but empowers future decisions.</p><p>Planning, specificity, and adaptability are essential, as showcased by Russell Wilson’s NFL journey. Influences around us, from media to social circles, significantly affect our mindset. Actively curating a positive environment, like Sarah’s negativity diet, can lead to enhanced mental well-being. Role models, whether celebrities or close family, guide our actions, teaching us the potency of attitude and the silent impact of our behaviors. And remembering the influence of role models and the power of choice, especially during challenges, can help steer a clearer path through life’s journey.</p><h2><span id=About_the_Author>About the Author</span></h2><p>The late <strong>Trevor Moawad</strong>, a Mental Conditioning coach, was the president of Moawad Consulting Group and co-founder of Limitless Minds. <strong>Andy Staples</strong> covered college football for Sports Illustrated for more than a decade.</p><h2><span id=Genres>Genres</span></h2><p>Motivation, Inspiration, Productivity, Personal Development</p><h2><span id=Table_of_Contents>Table of Contents</span></h2><p>Foreword xi<br>Prologue 1<br>1 It Takes Neutral Thinking 21<br>2 It Takes a Plan 45<br>3 It Takes Hard Choices 69<br>4 It Takes a Verbal Governor 87<br>5 It Takes a Negativity Diet 99<br>6 It Takes an Ad Campaign in Your Brain 115<br>7 It Takes Visualizing 135<br>8 It Takes Self-Awareness 153<br>9 It Takes Pressure 179<br>10 It Takes Leadership 195<br>11 It Takes Role Models 221<br>12 It Takes What It Takes 229<br>Acknowledgments 237<br>Notes 247</p><h2><span id=Review>Review</span></h2><p>The book is a guide to developing a mindset of neutral thinking, which the author defines as a way of focusing on the present moment and the choices available, without being influenced by the past or the future. The author, Trevor Moawad, is a mental conditioning coach who has worked with elite athletes, business leaders, and military personnel, helping them overcome negativity and achieve their goals. He shares his insights and strategies from his experience, as well as stories and examples from his clients and mentors.</p><p>The book covers various topics, such as:</p><ul><li>How to understand the nature and impact of the Five D’s: distraction, division, disconnection, depression, and despair that lower our state of mind and separate us from our potential</li><li>How to elevate our state of mind by connecting with our purpose, values, and vision</li><li>How to develop a right now attitude and behavior that enable us to act on what we can control and ignore what we can’t</li><li>How to prospect effectively and fill our pipeline with qualified opportunities</li><li>How to adjust our messaging and value proposition to meet the needs and expectations of our customers</li><li>How to handle objections and close deals in any market condition</li><li>How to protect our territory from competitors and our profits from price erosion</li><li>How to retain and grow our existing customers by providing exceptional service and value</li><li>How to foster a culture of innovation and responsibility in our team or organization that supports neutral thinking</li></ul><p>The book is divided into three parts: The Power of Neutral Thinking, The Neutral Thinking Playbook, and Neutral Thinking in Action. In the first part, the author explains the concept of neutral thinking and how it differs from positive or negative thinking. He argues that neutral thinking is more realistic and effective than positive thinking, which can be unrealistic and misleading.
