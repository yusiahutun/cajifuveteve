"Johnny brought Foy into my life a few years ago, and, immediately, he became a very close friend. He also got to know my daughter, Coco, and a song was born," the star told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>People</a> magazine.</p><p class=text-center id=eHZnLFim8kPI><span><strong></strong></span><strong></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/eadaf6ee0e3b-coco-arquette-z.jpg><p class=text-center id=ed4yw5juBpny data-wc=9><strong>Coco Arquette stars in the new Foy Vance video</strong></p><p id=ePgPcjGD1Gdj data-wc=69>The endearing video begins with Coco waking up from a sweet slumber and blissfully enjoying her day riding bikes, eating ice cream and frolicking on a beach. "From the first time Foy played for me – and every time I've heard it since – I've felt he captured, not only Coco's unique personality but also the beautiful childhood innocence that sadly, but inevitably, fades with time," Courteney admitted.</p><p id=eDWMlvdG2Otk data-wc=45>She added, "It is like a snapshot of the world as seen through a child's eyes ... sung by a man who is moved by how the world seems from her perspective. I think it's a perspective that we, as adults, never stop longing for."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bcabb276536e-coco-arquette1-a.jpg><p class=text-center id=eMOFttkDhA-G data-wc=5><strong>Courteney directed the music video</strong></p><p id=egX5W6EaYTD- data-wc=80>Coco turned out to be a family project for the mother-daughter duo, with Courteney directing Foy's sentimental music video. "As soon as I wrote the song – which started out as an off the cuff verse to make Coco laugh – it was obvious that Courteney would direct the video," Foy revealed to . "They both have such beautifully inquisitive spirits and kind hearts. Mix that with a killer sense of humor and you've got the Courteney/Coco double act!"</p><p id=edsNWi2w7rJ3 data-wc=74>Naturally the actress was "thrilled" to be asked to direct the video featuring her little girl. "My hope is that I conveyed in a visual way the many levels of feeling that Foy's song so brilliantly expressed," she said. "I am struck and continue to be struck by Foy's incredible soul as a musician and father. He is a truly unique human being, and I am proud to call him a friend."</p><p id=e9e6TcZjNHLT data-wc=35>The 52-year-old actress welcomed her daughter in 2004 with her now ex-husband David. Courteney’s best Jennifer Aniston, who recently shared her thoughts on perhaps "some day" becoming a mother, serves as one of Coco's godmothers.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">Foy Vance - "Coco" [Official Video]</a><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
