Enter: knotless braids. You're probably wondering, "When to comes to knotless braids vs box braids, what's the main difference?" Well, firstly, they're knotless — okay, you probably guessed that. So, we'll let Susan Oludele, celebrity hairstylist and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Hair by Susy</a>, explain further.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-knotless-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What are Knotless Braids?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Basically, knotless braids are not created using the traditional knot that's used when feeding in braiding hair. "Knotless braids look natural and effortless," says Oludele. "With regular box braids, you can tell extension has been used because of the knot at the beginning." She adds that knotless braids are created using the feed-in method, which involves adding braiding hair to the natural hair as you go along, as opposed to the regular braiding technique where the hair extension is knotted to the hair at the beginning.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-are-knotless-braids-a-good-protective-style></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Are Knotless Braids a Good Protective Style?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fall is the time of year to start thinking about protective styles as the cold weather can be particularly harsh on natural hair. "Knotless braids are a great protective style as they help to improve hair growth by protecting the hair strands," says Oludele. "It's also very easy to moisturize your scalp and keep the hair hydrated while wearing the braids."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If your last experience of braiding your hair left you with memories of being up all night from the excruciating pain caused by the tension of the braids on your scalp, you'll be pleased to know that knotless braids have a lot less tension on the scalp, which means a lot less pain. "Installing knotless braids involves minimal pulling at the root which means less breakage and more comfort," adds <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Sabrina Rowe</a>, celebrity hairstylist and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Ntrl by Sabs</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-long-does-it-take-to-install-knotless-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Long Does It Take to Install Knotless Braids?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although knotless braids are a painless <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>protective style</a>, you might find the amount of time it takes to install them a bit of a pain. According to Rowe, installing a full head of braids takes an average of five hours. However, it all depends on the stylist and both the size and length of your braids.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-the-best-way-to-prepare-your-hair-before-installing-knotless-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is the Best Way to Prepare Your Hair Before Installing Knotless Braids?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Deep cleaning your hair is paramount to remove any buildup before your braid service. Failure to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wash your hair</a> before braiding can cause an unbearably itchy scalp and decrease the life span of the braids. "An apple cider vinegar rinse is a wonderful treatment to get the hair and scalp ready for your appointment," says Rowe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Both stylists agree that it's also important to blow dry your hair before braiding so it's stretched and detangled — this helps to speed up the process so the stylist can get right into braiding the hair, says Rowe.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-whats-the-best-way-to-maintain-knotless-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What's the Best Way to Maintain Knotless Braids?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After sitting still for five hours to have your hair braided, you'll definitely want the style to last. It's important to make sure your hair is getting enough moisture to avoid <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>breakage</a>. There's no point rocking a protective style and neglecting your natural hair — moisture is crucial, especially during the fall. Oludele recommends greasing the scalp with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Ouee Hair Oil</a>, a product she created to revitalize hair follicles, stimulate the scalp and promote hair growth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another way to prolong the life of your braids is to cover your head at night. "Keeping your hair in a silk or satin scarf or bonnet while you sleep helps to prevent frizz and pulling," says Rowe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: You'll Be Seeing These 4 Hairstyles Everywhere This Fall</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-do-you-wash-knotless-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Do You Wash Knotless Braids?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to washing knotless braids, you're going to want to take your time and work through sections of the hair gently. Hurriedly washing the braids and rubbing them together will cause them to frizz up and possibly unravel. To make sure your knotless braids don't turn into a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>frizz</a> ball as you wash them, Oludele recommends lathering shampoo and conditioner through the hair in a downward motion to keep the braids smooth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The products you use to wash your knotless braids are also important. Avoid using shampoos with strong fragrances as the scent will linger on the braids after the shampoo has been washed out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I love using my <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>NTRL by Sabs Shampoo and Conditioner Bars</a> to wash knotless braids," says Rowe. "The bars are long-lasting and can be applied directly on the scalp and hair without building up in the braids. Liquid shampoos can be messy and hard to completely rinse out of braids."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-often-should-you-wash-knotless-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Often Should You Wash Knotless Braids?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On average, most stylists recommend washing your knotless braids once or twice a month. However, if you work out often and have an oily or dandruff-prone scalp, Rowe suggests washing your hair more frequently. "It's important to mention that the more often you wash, the more prone your roots and braids will be to frizz," says the stylist. "As long as you know what you're getting into, you can wash at your own discretion."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-long-do-knotless-braids-last></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Long Do Knotless Braids Last?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With proper care, knotless braids can last up to two months — Rowe says it's not advised to keep them longer. Knotless braids tend to get frizzier a lot faster than regular braids as they expose more natural hair at the root. So, if you're looking for a protective style that can last longer than two months, regular box braids are a better option.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">How do you know when the braids are coming to the end of their style-span? "When your roots are exposed and they require a lot of touching up for them to look neat you're coming to the end of the road," says Rowe. "If the braids begin to feel heavy on your new hair growth, that's also a sign to take them out."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-do-you-remove-knotless-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Do You Remove Knotless Braids?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As great as knotless braids look, be assured that it's going to take you a couple of hours to remove them. Both Oludele and Rowe say using a tail comb to remove knotless braids makes the process a lot easier and quicker.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I start at the bottom of the braids and use my comb to loosen them, working my way up the hair to remove them safely," says Rowe. Oludele adds that using a tail comb helps to quickly unravel the braids.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-much-do-knotless-braids-cost-to-install></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Much Do Knotless Braids Cost to Install?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On average, the cost of knotless braids starts at $250. However, this depends entirely on your stylist's level of experience, the type of hair you are installing, the length of your braids, and your location.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-frequently-asked-questions-e91a7ac5-deb3-4df7-843f-0a9db2ebcef5></span><h2 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__title>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content mntl-accordion js-accordion" readability=49><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=1 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Are knotless braids for good for thin hair?</span></p><p>Knotless braids are a great option for thin hair because there is less tension at the root, which could cause additional thinning to already fragile hair.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=2 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How do you sleep with knotless braids?</span></p><p>To keep your braids from frizzing at the root, you'll want to make sure to sleep with a tight scarf or extra large bonnet.
