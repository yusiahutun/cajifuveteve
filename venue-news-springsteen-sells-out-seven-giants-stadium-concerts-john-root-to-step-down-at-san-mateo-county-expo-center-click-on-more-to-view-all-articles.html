Since becoming general manager of the San Mateo County Expo Center in 1987, Root has helped transform the facility into one of the leading hosts of consumer shows in Northern California. The Expo Center, including the annual 10-day fair, attracts more than one million visitors annually to consumer and trade shows. Root was previously general manager of the Cow Palace in Daly City for more than 11 years.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebrityaccess.com/news/grafix/newsbulletic.gif border=0 align=center style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><b>D.C.
