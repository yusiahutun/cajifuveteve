After career a rookie career in NFL, Taylor has been pursuing a career as an actor. Who is he? What’s his net worth? Did he actually play in NFL?</p><p>Here is what we’ve discovered about Taylor.</p><h3><strong>Taylor Sele On Survival Of The Thickest</strong></h3><p>Taylor Sele is taking on the role of Jacque on Netflix’s upcoming show Survival of the Thickest. Created by comedian Michelle Buteau, and writer-producer Danielle Sanchez-Witzel (<i>New Girl</i>), the show is based on Buteau’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">book</a> of the same name.</p><p>The show’s synopsis reads, “Mavis, an assistant fashion stylist in Manhattan, aspires to become a lead stylist — and her hot photographer boyfriend, Jacque, is supporting her every step of the way. He even helps her secure an interview at&nbsp;<i>Essence</i>. Despite all his professions of love and devotion, though, Mavis later finds him in bed with another woman.”</p><p>It continues further, “So she moves out of their luxury apartment in Manhattan and into cramped quarters in Brooklyn with an oddball roommate. It’s pretty rough — and being a single thirtysomething can be awkward — but Mavis is committed to enjoying her life and making waves in the fashion industry — even without the leg up from Jacque. Luckily, her best friends Khalil and Marley are there every step of the way to encourage her to be her best self… or to let her know when she’s being completely unhinged.”</p><p>The show comes from A24. On Jan. 24,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Deadline</a>&nbsp;reported that Netflix had given&nbsp;Survival of the Thickest a series order with Buteau playing the leading character. The show will premiere on 13 July 2023.</p><h3><strong>Did Taylor Sele Play In The NFL?</strong></h3><p>Yes, a former Boston College wide receiver and standout special teams player signed a rookie free-agent contract yesterday with the Washington Redskins.
