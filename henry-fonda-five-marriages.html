Douglas A. Roberts in the stage and film versions of Mister Roberts, and Juror No. 8 in 12 Angry Men. But the man behind the persona was very different, leading to complicated relationships with his children and a tumultuous marriage history. Fonda was married five times, but rarely spoke about his relationships.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Henry Jaynes Fonda was born in 1905 in Grand Island, Nebraska.

(As the mother of Marlon Brando, she probably knew potential acting talent when she saw it.) Fonda was quickly hooked and journeyed to Massachusetts with a friend to join a summer stock theater group. There he met his future first wife, Margaret Sullavan.</p><img alt="Photograph, White, Black-and-white, Snapshot, Fun, Photography, Monochrome, Monochrome photography, Smile, Event, " title="Photograph, White, Black-and-white, Snapshot, Fun, Photography, Monochrome, Monochrome photography, Smile, Event, " width=1024 height=761 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/46/1510597233-margaret-sullavan-peter-fonda-themoonsourhome-1936.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Getty Images</span><p>Margaret and Henry in \'The Moon\'s Our Home\</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">A stage and screen actress nominated for an Oscar for her performance in Three Comrades in 1938, Sullavan was known to be blunt and temperamental.

It's no wonder the couple separated after they had been married for only two months and divorced two years later in 1933. But they remained on friendly terms and even acted together in 1936's The Moon's Our Home.</p><img alt="Photograph, Facial expression, Vintage clothing, Headgear, Smile, Formal wear, Suit, Retro style, Event, Dress, " title="Photograph, Facial expression, Vintage clothing, Headgear, Smile, Formal wear, Suit, Retro style, Event, Dress, " width=1505 height=1125 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/46/1510598375-henry-fonda-frances-seymour-brokaw-wedding.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Getty Images</span><p>Henry and Frances on their wedding day</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Fonda met his second wife, socialite Frances Seymour Brokaw, on the set of the film Wings of the Morning in England in 1936.

Four months later, at age 42, she committed suicide by slitting her throat with a stolen razor.
