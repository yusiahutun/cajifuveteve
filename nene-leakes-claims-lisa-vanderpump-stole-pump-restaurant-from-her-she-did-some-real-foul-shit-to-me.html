NeNe Leakes has claimed that Lisa Vanderpump stole the idea for Pump Restaurant from her.
If you recall, the &#34;Real Housewives of Atlanta&#34; star told Andy Cohen on &#34;Watch What Happens Live&#34; last week that she wanted to go &#34;head to head&#34; with Beverly Hills Housewife Lisa Rinna."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"I've never really addressed it...She did some real foul shit to me."</p><p>"So maybe the rumors are true that she manipulates people," McCarthy pointed out and NeNe replied, "She does. Listen, Imma just tell you. This is the first time I've really spoke out and you'll get some really good juicy shit."</p><p>The reality star then recalled that a few years ago, while she and her husband Gregg were living in Los Angeles as NeNe was working on "Glee" and "New Normal," she had an idea to open a bar in West Hollywood.</p><p>"We would ride down that West Hollywood area where all the gay bars are, and I have a large gay fan base," NeNe said to McCarthy. "I kept thinking 'it would be so cool if I had a bar right in here somewhere.' And that space was empty and kind of raggedy-looking and torn down."</p><p>NeNe explained that she noticed that popular gay bar The Abbey was close by. "I said, 'This is a cool spot because I can get some of the business from The Abbey.' I have a large gay fan base."</p><p>The actress said she was still "not so sure" about the area, so she called up Lisa, who at the time already was the owner of Villa Blanca and SUR.</p><p>"She said, 'Oh darling, darling, it's a piece of crap and they're charging so much for it darling,'" Leakes said. "She talked me off of it and then went and got it."</p><p>"Oh my god, NeNe!" McCarthy yelled in response and Leakes replied, "Yes, she did. That's so f--ked up...Next thing I know it was like Pump and I was like, 'Is this bitch serious?'"</p><p>NeNe explained that she and Lisa haven't actually said anything about the issue since, but NeNe claimed it's something that's unspoken, but known between them."Now when she sees me, she's like 'Hi NeNe,'" NeNe said.</p><p>TooFab has reached out to Lisa Vanderpump for comment, but has yet to hear back.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
