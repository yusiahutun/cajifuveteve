On more than one occasion, we’ve <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>dropped some dough on dresses</a> from this store and often <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>head to the site</a> when we want to stock up on cozy knits and quality denim. We’re not the only ones, either — <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>celebrities</a> and fashion influencers love the label, too. Still, we’ve often wondered if there are other brands like Reformation that we might be missing out on and are ready to hit up a few other retailers with similar offerings.</p><p>When pulling together our list of brands like Reformation, we did have a few requirements. First, that our picks nailed Ref’s same timeless yet modern aesthetic, selling basics with a twist and/or easy, statement-making pieces we can wait to slip on. Two, we wanted to consider sustainability efforts and the treatment of employees. Reformation has made multiple moves to <a href=# rel=nofollow>protect the planet</a>, including being committed to circular fashion and using non-toxic, quality materials. It also cares about its workers, paying fair wages and prioritizing healthy work environments.</p><p>With all that in mind, check out our list of brands like Reformation, ahead, from those with comparable price points to ones that are less or slightly more expensive (but totally worth it).</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=14.785546415981><h2>Madewell</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Madewell-Stores-Like-Reformation.jpeg><p>Like Reformation, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Madewell</a> is responsible for creating the bread and butter of our wardrobe. Not-so-basic staples, such as everyday jeans and crisp button-downs, are readily available at a reasonable price point (many items range from $50 to $200) and you don’t even have to head to another store for footwear or accessories —&nbsp;those items are part of the mix.</p><p>When it comes to sustainability, Madeweell also offers <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.madewell.com/do-well/report.html#content>a full report on how it’s doing</a> and in 2023, launched products made with regenerative cotton.

Um, don’t mind if we do!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-Plus-Curvy-90s-Straight-Jean.jpeg><p>Madewell’s denim collection is packed with eye-catching shapes and colorways, whether you’re looking for a relaxed wide-leg, something skinny, or a playful pair of overalls. Sizing is also inclusive, and aside from <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>going up to 28W,</a> some options allow you to select tall and petite lengths.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Ribbed-Half-Zip-Sweater-in-Stripe.jpeg><p>Although this brand’s lineup of button-downs remains unmatched, the sweaters are pretty spectacular, too. We’re already thinking of all the ways we can work <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>this striped half-zip</a> into our outfits this spring, including pairing it with soft, linen pants or denim shorts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Madewell-The-Essential-Bucket-Tote.jpeg><p>Welcome to your new favorite place to buy work bags. Nothing beats Madewell’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>The Essential Bucket Tote</a>, which looks as sleek as your everyday purse but is large enough to fit a laptop, wallet, water bottle, and much more.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=14.712422007941><h2>Everlane</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Brands-Like-Reformation-Everlane.jpg><p>If you’re a big fan of Reformation’s basics, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Everlane</a> deserves a spot on your shopping list. Here, you’ll find timeless essentials such as crewneck T-shirts, comfy knits, and linen dresses, not to mention a large selection of shoes you’ll want to reach for day after day.</p><p>The store is also open about its sustainability efforts and product descriptions highlight things like the use of recycled materials, cleaner chemistry, and responsible forestry. Now, you know what you’re buying before you add to cart.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Everlane-The-Supima-Cotton-Boyfriend-Shirt.jpeg><p>There’s a reason these <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>simple, striped button-downs</a> are a mainstay in our rotation. They’re versatile enough to dress up or down and look just as great with a pair of jeans as they do with a sequin skirt. Everlane’s collared shirts are also loved by Meghan Markle, and since this one is made with Supima® cotton, it’s extra durable and won’t fall apart in the wash.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-Linen-Side-Button-Jumpsuit.jpeg><p>This <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>sleeveless jumpsuit</a> is super similar to something we’d see on Reformation’s site. Not only is it the perfect one-and-done look for warmer days, but layering a light turtleneck underneath will make it work for chillier temperatures, too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Everlane-The-Day-Mule.jpeg><p>If your sandal collection could use an update, consider investing in Everlane’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>woven mules</a> Aside from being neutral enough to balance out summer’s brightest, boldest prints, the leather comes from a tannery that’s rated Gold by the Leather Working Group, which means it demonstrates best practices when it comes to environmental compliance and performance capabilities.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=14.014527845036><h2>Rumored</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Brands-Like-Reformation-Rumored.jpeg><p>We like to think of <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Rumored</a> as Reformation’s less expensive cousin. While there’s a lot to love about this brand, we’re especially fond of all the long, printed dresses, which not only make for great wedding guest attire but can be worn for fancy date nights.</p><p>Rumored might not be as environmentally conscious as Reformation, but it does keep sustainability in mind when creating clothing. To minimize waste, the store produces everything in its <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>own factory</a> and also offers the option of carbon-neutral shipping through Route.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rumored-SUNSET-STRIP-MAXI-DRESS.jpg><p>If you’ve always lusted after the Andie Anderson dress from How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, now’s your chance to score the 2024 version. This <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>bright yellow maxi</a> is elegant and timeless, and you’re bound to break it out for years to come, whether it’s for weddings, vacation dinners, or Halloween.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rumored-Sunday-Onesie.jpg><p>Sure, you’ll find some great going-out looks on Rumored’s site, but you won’t want to miss out on the brand’s laid-back athleisure designs. This <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>black and white romper</a> is a smart solution for days when you’re in a pinch and would work just as well for outdoor hikes as it would for brunch plans or weekend errands.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/rumored-versailles-mini-dress.jpg><p>Ready to try the exposed bra trend? Rumored has you covered — or, uh, uncovered. Similar to <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Reformation’s Lovella Linen Dress</a> ($228), this <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>lacy design</a> includes a faux bra detail up top, which not only adds some interest but takes the sexiness to the next level.</p><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$98</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>138</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>29% Off</span></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=10.349912229374><h2>Maeve</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Brands-Like-Reformation-Maeve.jpeg><p>Reformation describes itself as making “effortless silhouettes that celebrate the feminine figure” and that sentence alone reminds us of <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Maeve</a>. The Anthropologie brand is behind some of our favorite pairs of structured pants and floaty sundresses, and just like Ref, it doesn’t shy away from including color or whimsical prints.</p><p>Something else that’s great about Maeve is that you won’t have to shell out tons of money should you want to try something new. Many of the brand’s pieces are also available to rent on <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Nuuly</a>, so you could essentially rock a different look each week without depleting your bank account.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Maeve-Sleeveless-Square-Neck-Column-Midi-Dress.jpeg><p>More than once we’ve fallen in love with a <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>floral dress on Reformation’s site</a>…only to realize it doesn’t go beyond a size 12. Thankfully, Maeve sells <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>similar styles</a> up to a 26W, allowing more people to embrace the spirit of spring with pretty, printed frocks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-Colette-Cropped-Wide-Leg-Pants-by-Maeve.jpeg><p>If you’re spending over $100 on a pair of pants, chances are you’re hoping to get some solid use out of them. <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>These babies</a> appear structured but are surprisingly stretchy, which means they’ll double as an office staple and casual weekend wear.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Maeve-Slim-Scalloped-Denim-Skirt.jpeg><p>Both Reformation and Anthropologie sell their fair share of cute denim skirts, but <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>this scalloped design</a> from Maeve gives this classic piece an eye-catching twist. Let it steal the spotlight by styling it with a simple tank or go big and bold by adding a puff-sleeved or ruffled top.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=16.93429844098><h2>DÔEN</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Brands-Like-Reformation-DOEN.webp?w=585"><p>One brand that’s often compared to Reformation is <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>DÔEN</a>. While slightly higher in price, a quick scroll through the site will leave you lusting after sweet embroidered cardigans, ruched dresses, and printed sets.</p><p>On top of being transparent about its <a rel=nofollow href=#>environmental impact</a> and fair treatment of workers, DÔEN is also a favorite among some major stars — Taylor Swift, Kaia Gerber, Kylie Jenner, Meghan Markle, and Brie Larson are just a few big names that have stepped out in these easy, effortless pieces. Plus, if you have or know a little one, you’ll also be able to shop from its selection of stylish children’s clothes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/doen-teresa-cardigan-ivy.jpg><p>DÔEN produces pieces that are meant to last forever and, if you ask us, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>this cardigan</a> is a must-have from the brand. Created from a blend of wool and cashmere with a satin lining and hand-embroidered details, it gives off a classic, 1950 vibe that feels more timeless than trendy. There’s no doubt this knit will spice up your jeans or pair well with an A-line midi skirt.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/KATHERINA-DRESS_SALT_10.webp?w=650"><p>This store is the spot where you’ll find those pieces you end up wearing way too often. We’re already imagining all the occasions where the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Katherina Dress</a> will come in handy; the elasticated smocking makes it stretchy and easy to pull on, while the longer length and puff-sleeve details give it a somewhat dressy twist.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GIULIETTA-SKIRT_YELLOW-ROSE_04.jpg><p>Is it possible for a skirt to be both casual and sexy? The answer is yes — especially if we’re talking about the <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Giulietta Skirt</a>. This lace-trimmed, lingerie-like bottom can easily be worn with a basic tee or sweatshirt, transforming those laid-back tops into a pulled-together, fashion-forward ensemble.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=13.403865717192><h2>Faithfull the Brand</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Brands-Like-Reformation-Faithfull-the-Brand.jpeg><p>If your spring and summer aesthetic is leaning toward a coastal Italian vibe, chances are you’re already well-acquainted with Reformation’s silk dresses and linen suits. Still, if you’re searching for more of the like, don’t skip out on <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Faithfull the Brand</a>, another label that sells dreamy, easy-to-wear essentials.</p><p>Behind the scenes, Faithfull the Brand works with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>family-run factories</a> in Indonesia and prices its pieces based on intricacy and difficulty to make. Its clothes are made with fibers and fabrics that have a low environmental impact and your package will even arrive in a biodegradable bag. Of course, there’s extra proof the company cares about its workers and is focused on being more sustainable: Faithfull the Brand is officially B Corp certified.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Delfina-Vest-Bleached-Sand.jpg><p>Our favorite style stars have moved beyond structured pants and are now working <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>button-down vests</a> into their outfits.

This <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>dark brown design</a> features the eye-catching pattern throughout, adding an element of playfulness to an otherwise simple, puff-sleeved shirtdress.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sol-Bikini-Top-Rosella-Floral.jpeg><p>Something else that’s great about this label is that if you fall in love with a specific print, there’s more than one way to wear it. For instance, this red “rosella floral” graphic is available for both <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>bikini tops</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>bottoms</a>, but you’ll also find it on additional items like a <a rel=nofollow href=#>wrap skirt</a>, <a rel=nofollow href=#>maxi dress</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>mini dress</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=13.072131147541><h2>Meshki</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Brands-Like-Reformation-Meshki-1.jpeg><p>Not everyone is a fan of Reformation’s prices, and if you’re looking to shop fun, quality items for less than $100, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Meshki</a> is here to help you out.
