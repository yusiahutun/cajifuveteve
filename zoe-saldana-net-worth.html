The history-making actress originally studied dance at a Dominican Republic conservatory and made her movie debut in the 2000 film Center Stage.</p><p>“When I started acting I always felt alienated because I was considered exotic, or different, or too skinny for this, or too light for that. These pigeonholes can only make you feel different or excluded. Over time you just start to ask yourself, ‘When will I be considered for what I have to contribute?’” Saldana told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Forbes</a> in 2017 of her early career.</p><p>Aside from acting, she dedicates time to improving diversity in Hollywood with her organization, BeSe, whose mission is to broaden and reshape the cultural narrative by shining light on the untold stories that reflect today’s America. She told Forbes: “I really want to broaden and reshape the narrative so that I can better reflect the America we see today when we walk outside our front door. I want to unite us, by celebrating our diversity. Half of America today, under the age of 35, is multicultural. And half of that is Latino but this is not reflected in our mainstream media. I want to participate in the broadening of the narrative.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MCDGUOF_WD021.jpg><h2><strong>How much does Zoe Saldana make from the Guardians of the Galaxy movies</strong><strong>?</strong></h2><p>How much does Zoe Saldana make from Guardians of the Galaxy?
