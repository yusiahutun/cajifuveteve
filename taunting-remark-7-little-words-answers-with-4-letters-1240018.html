While modern-day children are spending more time on digital devices, word puzzles can still be an effective way to help their education. Here are a few reasons why word puzzles are essential for your child's development:</p><p>Enhance and refine spelling abilities<br>Word puzzles can help children to practice the spelling rules they learn in school while reinforcing these rules each time they complete a puzzle. Crosswords, in particular, require correct spelling to solve, and word puzzles can make learning spelling fun by making anagrams for your child to unscramble.</p><p><strong>Increase vocabulary</strong></p><p>The more words your child encounters, uses and understands, the more extensive their vocabulary will be. Word puzzles provide a simple way to introduce new words and definitions while encouraging them to use words in context.</p><p><strong>Improve working memory</strong></p><p>Working memory is a critical component of long-term and short-term memory. Crosswords and logic puzzles, which require children to recall vocabulary and definitions from memory, can help to improve their working memory, which can also enhance their learning and achievement.</p><p><strong>Enhance work pace</strong></p><p>Word puzzles can improve your child's processing speed, allowing them to arrive at solutions quickly. This not only helps with literacy but also with other classroom tasks that demand quick thinking, such as mental math.</p><p><strong>Boost problem-solving skills</strong></p><p>Crosswords and code breakers require children to consider how words interact with each other and to think logically and strategically. Word puzzles demand creativity and outside-the-box thinking, honing problem-solving skills while keeping children engaged.</p><p>Overall, word puzzles are a fun and exciting way to boost your child's vocabulary, spelling, working memory, processing speed, and problem-solving skills.</p><h2><strong>How do 7 Little Words Work?</strong></h2><p>The game 7 Little Words is addictive because of its simple formula that resembles a crossword or anagram game. Each puzzle contains seven clues for seven mystery words and several letter combinations that need to be combined to form words that match the clues.</p><p>The goal is to use all the letters to create seven words. The game relies on the process of elimination, so if you can't figure out a word, complete the others and try to experiment with the remaining letters. The game has 25 puzzles, and additional packs of 50 puzzles are available for a small fee.</p><p>The game is easy to play, but it lacks advanced features such as a fancy interface or game center achievements. However, it's still a fun and challenging word game worth trying out. The developer is also available on forums to listen to any suggestions for improvement.</p><h2 class=faq_title>Taunting remark 7 Little Words - FAQs</h2><p>1.
