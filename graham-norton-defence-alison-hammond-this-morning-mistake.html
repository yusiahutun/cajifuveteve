It was funny."&nbsp;</p><p id=eLMkkY-HvPni data-wc=60>Full of praise for&nbsp;'s new Friday presenter, he concluded: "I love Alison Hammond and if there was any awkwardness, it was my fault. I made it a bad thing. That’s the other thing, <strong>I feel like people then think I’m kind of heartless. I was bereft when the dog went, but now I can use it for comedy."&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eypvRcmQ9PU7 data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Graham Norton clarifies Strictly same-sex couples comment</a></strong></p><p id=ePAIX1hfsKfr data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Take a look inside Graham Norton's house</a></strong></p><p id=efpPBjeyO_Jk data-wc=37>At the time, Alison was mortified by her mistake and apologised to the star, saying: <strong>"Gutted, oh I'm so sorry.&nbsp;I'm absolutely devastated.
