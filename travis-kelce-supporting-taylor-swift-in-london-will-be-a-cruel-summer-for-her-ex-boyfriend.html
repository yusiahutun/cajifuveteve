The NFL tight end doesn’t seem to be feeling bored over flying across the world for his girlfriend Taylor Swift. Travis Kelce admitted he loves supporting his beau, and she feels the same.

The <a href=#>celebrity</a> gushed over Taylor’s talent in a recent interview, where he dished out the details.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-kelce-set-to-support-taylor-swift-in-london>Travis Kelce set to support Taylor Swift in London</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-2006866532-1024x683.jpg><p>The three-time <a href=#>Super Bowl</a> champ said discovering how the <a href=#>music</a> star does what she does, was ‘eye-opening’ in a new interview.</p><p>The <a href=#>NFL</a> star is on a PR press tour for his upcoming Kelce Jam Festival in Kansas City, but of course, he was asked about his relationship, which is the hottest in <a href=#>Hollywood</a>.</p><p>The 34-year-old said: “It’s definitely been fun to experience her taste in music, for sure.</p><p>“She’s so amazing at what she does. And to find that creativity to see where she likes to pull things from&nbsp;and just, really, how she listens to music is very eye-opening for me. It’s been fun to hear her take on it.”</p><p>The tight end then said she’s amazing at selling out stadiums. This comes as no surprise for her <a href=#>Eras Tour</a>, which is still running until the end of the year.</p><p>Kelce said of her dedicated fan base: “Man, I’ll tell you what. The London shows, I think she’s at Wembley eight times, which is mind-blowing that she can do that many shows in one stadium and fill that thing up.</p><p>“I played at Wembley once and I don’t even think we filled that thing up.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-i-have-to-support-you-know-it>‘I have to support – you know it’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-958845852-696x1024.jpg><p>Although <a href=#>Travis Kelce has traveled to Argentina</a>, flew thousands of <a href=#>miles to Singapore</a> and enjoyed a <a href=#>date at the zoo with Taylor in Sydney</a>, he’s not stopping there.</p><p>He’s planning to pack his backs to travel across the Atlantic for his Lover.</p><p>“Oh, you know, I gotta go support,” he <a href=# rel=nofollow>tells</a> ET. “You know it.”</p><p>But that’s one of the things he loves about the <a href=#>Grammy</a>-award winning singer-songwriter.</p><p>He added: “We’re both very career-driven. We both love what we do, and any chance that I can show my support to her – and knowing that she’s showing me all the support in the world throughout the season – it’s just been an amazing experience getting to know Tay.”</p><p>But what may be awkward, is the experience for <a href=#>Taylor Swift’s ex-boyfriend, Joe Alwyn</a>.</p><p>The pair dated for six years after supposedly meeting at the Met Gala.</p><p>Taylor even wrote a song about him, called London Boy, for her 2019 album Lover. And she sang his praises.</p><p>The pair broke up in April 2023, and he joined the long list of <a href=#>Taylor Swift’s ex-lovers</a>. But by August, she was dating Travis, as he admitted when and how they got together. Before Tay-Tay walked out into that VIP Suite in September, he said they were seeing each other for ‘about a month’ before making it official – and Taylor told Time Magazine they were a couple in September.</p><p>Let’s hope Joe doesn’t live near Wembley or he may hear her singing breakup songs all night.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2WBcMDRmq2iq12gsq2vxGaqrqigpL%2B1tc2gZK2ZqaG8s3nSsKCfrF2eu264zqebqKZdrLatuIybnGaZXZi%2FtrHLZqqupZ2av26yzqtkoZ2iYrK5ecGosJ%2BqmZq7pXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
