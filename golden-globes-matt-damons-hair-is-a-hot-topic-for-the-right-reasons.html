So when Matt Damon rocked up with his natural hair at the <a href=#>Golden Globes</a>, it set the right tone for Tinsel Town.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-matt-damon-embraces-his-natural-hair-at-the-golden-globes>Matt Damon embraces his natural hair at the Golden Globes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1916011198-1024x814.jpg><p>With a crowded room filled to the brim with A-listers, it can be difficult to focus on just one. The Red Carpet is packed with <a href=#>movie</a> stars, TV icons and everything in between. Even <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> made an appearance at the Golden Globes this year. There are a lot of legends in one space, that’s for sure. So when one celebrity appears to set themselves apart from the crop, it makes a big sound.</p><p><a href=#>Matt Damon</a> rocked up with his natural hair at the Golden Globes, and it’s exactly what is needed in Hollywood.</p><p>He showed off his gray locks, reminding us of how a younger George Clooney did the same a number of years ago.</p><p>The pressure of looking good, being dressed in designer clothes and always being ‘on camera’ can be a lot to handle. But when a star isn’t afraid of displaying what happens naturally – aging – it’s almost like a dig at Hollywood (and rightly so).</p><p>We adore talent and dedication from these stars who choose showbiz as their career, not their looks.</p><p>It also caught the attention of fans, although not always for the right reasons:</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-can-t-get-over-ben-and-matt-s-true-friendship>Fans can’t get over Ben and Matt’s ‘true friendship’</h2><p>Another moment was highlighted throughout the night, and it wasn’t all about Matt Damon’s hair at this year’s Golden Globes.</p><p><a href=#>Award shows</a> aren’t just a place to hand over small statues to some of the most well-known people on the planet. It’s also an opportunity for former friends, co-stars and new relationships to mingle and catch up.</p><p>One sweet moment with Matt Damon and <a href=#>Ben Affleck</a> also warmed the hearts of fans.</p><p>Cameras caught a clip of Ben Affleck surprising his longtime friend at his table, by walking up without hesitation after seeing him out the side of his eye. Matt beams from ear to ear and starts laughing. As Ben sits down next to him, Matt wraps his arm around his buddy as they enjoy a cute embrace.</p><p>Fans also enjoyed the sweet moment, and we agree.</p><p>One wrote: “It must be awesome to have a true friend from back then before all the madness happened. I‘m happy for Matt & Ben. That’s so real & rare in Hollywood.”</p><p>A second said: “Love Matt Damon. So low key and unassuming.”</p><p>A third added: “So cool. Love how they were room mates trying to make it in the industry and now they’re still this far down the road. Must be quite the feeling having a pal go this far with you.”</p><p>While a fourth echoed: “They are literally brothers from another mother.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2WFcLPOpZuepl2cubCuxKxkppmkqXqlrcyopaxlmJa2s3nIrGSaZZikwW7AzqmgnGWWpL9uwMeeZKuhl53Bbr7EmqqopqNk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
