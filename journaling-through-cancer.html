Journaling can be therapeutic for cancer survivors. Research shows that expressive writing can help reduce side effects, improve quality of life, and decrease medical visits for people with cancer. Writing can help you to cope with your illness. During times of distress, it can be emotionally healing.
Expressive writing can take on many forms."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Research shows that expressive writing can help reduce <strong><a href=#>side effects</a></strong>, improve quality of life, and decrease medical visits for people with cancer. Writing can help you to cope with your illness. During times of distress, it can be emotionally healing.</p><p>Expressive writing can take on many forms. You can write email, letters, blogs, journals, social media posts, creative essays, poetry, and fiction. Writing – through a blog, social media platform, or email newsletter – can also be a helpful way to keep your extended family and friends updated on your treatment and recovery.</p><p>Journaling is one form of writing that can be particularly beneficial. Journaling gives you an opportunity to reflect on what happened during your day. Writing down the things that are worrying you can actually <strong><a href=#>reduce your anxiety</a></strong>. This can be particularly beneficial before bedtime, as it might just <strong><a href=#>help you sleep better.</a></strong><br>When people think of journaling, they tend to picture someone writing down a daily chronicle of their life. But journaling can be much more than a personal diary. Let’s explore a few different methods of journaling you can try out.</p><ul><li><span class=has-inline-color>Art journaling</span>: Draw or scrapbook what you are feeling.</li><li><span class=has-inline-color>Dream journaling</span>: Write down the first two or three words that come into your mind when you wake up; these words can help you recall your dreams.</li><li><span class=has-inline-color>Gratitude journaling:</span> Write down what you are <strong><a href=#>grateful</a></strong> for each day. This allows you to focus on the positive aspects of your life.</li><li><span class=has-inline-color>Humor journaling:</span> Find the <strong><a href=#>humor</a></strong> in a situation and write about it. Comedic outlets can help improve your mood.</li><li><span class=has-inline-color>Line-a-day journaling:</span> Limit yourself to writing just one sentence per day.</li><li><span class=has-inline-color>Stream-of-consciousness writing: </span>Write down everything that comes to your mind. It’s OK if it comes out nonsensical.</li></ul><p>There is no right or wrong way to write or journal. Try not to focus on grammar, spelling, or sentence structure when you are journaling or writing for emotional healing. Just write what you feel.</p><p>Check to see if your cancer center offers writing or journaling workshops. Many of these have moved online due to <strong><a href=#>COVID-19</a></strong>. If there’s not one available, you can check with local community agencies that might offer this type of program, or join an online journaling group.</p><p>However, you do not need to attend a class or workshop to start writing. Just look for ways to incorporate expressive writing in your everyday routine:</p><ul><li><span class=has-inline-color>Keep a journal of your cancer journey.</span> You can write each day before bed to help you process what happened that day. Or just pick any time that works for you and your schedule.</li><li><span class=has-inline-color>Blog about your experiences.</span> Although this is a more public form of expression, it can be a way to build community and share your story with others facing similar situations. Or, you can try a website like <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CaringBridge.org,</a></strong> which allows you to <strong><a href=#>create your own personal blog</a></strong> to share your cancer journey with friends and family.</li><li>Take a few minutes each day to just write what’s on your mind without censoring yourself or worrying about grammar and spelling.</li><li><span class=has-inline-color>Write letters to friends or family members. </span>You can tell them things that might be difficult for you to say aloud.</li></ul><p>You can experience the pleasure and emotional healing of writing, even during cancer. All you need is a pen and paper – or a computer – and a few quiet minutes to express yourself.</p><h4 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Give It a Try!</h4><p>Are you ready to give expressive writing a try? You can make up your own writing prompt, or pick one of the prompts below to get started.</p><ul><li>Write down the story that is told over and again at family gatherings.</li><li>Tell the story of who you were&nbsp;named after.</li><li>Describe what is on your refrigerator.&nbsp;Magnets, notes, photographs?</li><li>Did you procrastinate on an important task this week? Did you finally finish something you’ve been trying to do for a long time? Write about it!</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/copingmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Snow-Art.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/copingmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/snow-head-shot.png><p>Dr. Alison Snow (left) is the director of Cancer Supportive Services at Mount Sinai Downtown Cancer Centers in New York, NY.
