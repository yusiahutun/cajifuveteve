Your enthusiasm is contagious, and with Leo season in full effect, there’s no better time to discover and reconnect with your passions. That said, before we discuss <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">how the new moon in Leo of August 2023 will affect each zodiac sign</a>, it’s important to hold space for your inner child and your heart’s desires. What brings you joy? Do you feel confident exploring your natural curiosities? Renowned Swiss psychiatrist and psychotherapist Carl Jung was a Leo sun, and he really couldn’t have said it better: “The privilege of a lifetime is to become who you truly are.”</p><p>Majestic and high-spirited, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Leo’s zodiac archetype</a> is a representation of creation, fertility, individuality, leadership, and creative expression. Governed by the sun—the center of the universe and our greatest source of energy—it’s no wonder Leo natives find comfort in being the center of attention. Their sparkling charisma and sunny disposition is more than often associated with fame and royalty, but there’s so much more to this fire sign than meets the eye. On the surface, it’s easy to assume their confidence stems from an egotistical place, but their ability to glow from the inside out is part of their celestial mission. The source of all creation, the sun is symbolic of our divinity and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">soul purpose in astrology</a>… and when in a high vibration, Leo brings sunshine, energy, and vitality to the people around them. This, in turn, inspires and encourages others to be their most authentic selves, as they are accepted and celebrated in their presence.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/weeklyhoroscope9-12-22.png><p>Don’t have Leo prominently placed <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in your birth chart</a>? You’re still not off the hook, as we all have a little bit of each sign in our birth chart. For instance, check <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">which of the 12 astrological houses</a> belong to Leo in your birth chart. Believe it or not, this is the area of life where you’re capable of shining as bright as the sun. Whether it be your sixth house of health and fitness or perhaps your committed relationship sector, this is where you’re most likely to take the lead, and be unapologetically yourself. With all of that being said, August’s new moon will renew itself via 23 degrees of Leo on August 16 at exactly 5:38 a.m. ET.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">new moon phase</a> is an incredibly fertile time, so don’t be discouraged by the moon’s lack of visibility. On the contrary, in addition to marking the beginning of the lunar cycle, the new moon occurs when the sun joins the moon, and via the exact same degree of a zodiac sign. In this case, the moon will renew itself in Leo, so be sure to reflect on what you would like to manifest within the next six months, specifically when it comes to themes of creativity, leadership, passion projects, and self-expression. Moreover, it’s important to consider the effects of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Venus retrograde in Leo</a>, as it will be traveling just a few degrees behind this new moon. However, with the planet of relationships, finances and value systems lingering in the shadows, this could trigger the desire to remain incognito, and work on something behind the scenes.</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1><p>The new moon in Leo takes place on August 16 at 5:38 p.m. ET.</p></figure><p>Venus retrograde and the new moon will be at odds <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with change-maker Uranus</a>, forming quite the shocking and volatile square, which is where things are bound to get a little weird. Look at it this way: Venus has been retrograde since July 22, asking us to re-assess and re-evaluate everything from our financial stability to our relationship dynamics. Self-love is also a big one for Venus retrograde in Leo, so keep that in mind. Meanwhile, the new moon is presenting us with a new beginning, where we can take the stage, and manifest our heart’s desires. Uranus, on the other hand, is adding a layer of disruption and unexpected changes to this new beginning, specifically when it comes to our sense of security. However, despite the chaos we’re likely to endure under this lunation, the rebel planet is shaking things up in our favor, and liberating us in the process.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Leo_horoscope__Zodiac_Signs_Crystals.gif?w=650"><p>There’s a silver lining though, as disruptive Uranus will simultaneously harmonize with Mercury & <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mars in Virgo</a>, bringing some much-needed grounding and support. For instance, where Uranus is prone to bringing unexpected changes, Mercury & Mars are providing us with the mental focus and problem-solving skills needed to simplify things moving forward.</p><p>Here’s what you can expect from the upcoming new moon in Leo, according to your <a href=#>sun sign</a>, <a href=#>moon sign</a> or <a href=#>rising sign</a> (and seriously, you’re missing out if you don’t read these horoscopes for your rising sign):</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.2143705463183><h2>Aries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Aries.png><p>Your perception of happiness is being brought to your attention under August’s new moon, as it will ignite your fifth house of authenticity, celebration, and hobbies. Whether creatively or in terms of love and romance, this is an opportunity for you to start again, and reconnect with what genuinely brings you joy. While at odds with rebellious Uranus, however, this new beginning may require you to venture out of your comfort zone. Fortunately, you have the help of your celestial ruler, Mars, as it is not only transiting meticulous Virgo, alongside Mercury, but also activating your sixth house of due diligence. This means, despite the chaos and unexpected changes, you have the mindset and resourcefulness to make this new beginning happen. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.7802850356295><h2>Taurus</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Taurus.png><p>Home means something completely different to everyone, but with the moon renewing itself via your fourth house of family, emotional foundations and innermost feelings, you are being presented a clean slate in this area of your life. If you were given the option, would you change anything specific about your home life? This could revolve around your family dynamics, or perhaps the desire to restructure something in your personal life. Either way, Luna will simultaneously square disruptive Uranus in your sign, which is where you might suddenly feel the urge to break free from an old way of being. Keep in mind, your celestial ruler, Venus, is also retrograde in your fourth house of home, adding a layer of introspection to your new beginning. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.3971078976641><h2>Gemini</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Gemini.png><p>Communication has always been your area of expertise, but you’re being called to take a closer look at your approach, and whether or not you feel comfortable in your authenticity. Whether socially or in terms of your mindset, this lunation is presenting you with an opportunity to express yourself confidently, and unapologetically. New moons hold space for new seeds of potential, so you’ll want to reflect on the dynamic of your immediate exchanges and communication style. Luna will also face off with change-maker Uranus—which just so happens to be wandering through the most secretive part of your chart—triggering disruption and/or an unexpected change of plans. Don’t hesitate to lean on your inner circle for support, even if this requires a certain amount of vulnerability on your part. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.8778877887789><h2>Cancer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Cancer.png><p>Count your blessings and don’t undermine your self-worth. This is especially significant with the moon renewing itself in Leo (your second house of finances, values, and stability). In addition to starting something new in this area of life, you’re being called to approach these energies like the leader you’re meant to be. If you’re no longer resonating with a previous investment, this could be the green light you’ve been waiting for. The same goes for those of you entertaining the thought of capitalizing on your talents and abilities, but here’s where it gets interesting. The new moon will go head-to-head with innovative Uranus which could, in turn, bring unexpected shake-ups to your friendship groups and social networks. The role you play in your community is being brought to the forefront. <a href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.2857894736842><h2>Leo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Leo.png><p>Cheers to your solar return, and your new beginning! It’s not everyday the sun and moon come together in your sign, so make it count. The moon is renewing itself in your fixed territory, surrounding you with new energies and opportunities that can help you level up in your personal life. Be it mentally, emotionally, or physically, your lunar makeover starts now. Do keep in mind, Venus is still retrograde in your sign, so it’s best to avoid cosmetic procedures and drastic changes in your beauty routine, but I digress. The new moon will face off with change-maker Uranus, creating a series of unexpected shakeups and changes, some of which revolve around your sense of authority. Don’t be discouraged if things take an unexpected turn. You have the support of Mars-Mercury in Virgo, bringing the necessary tools and assistance in your money sector.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.7592190889371><h2>Virgo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Virgo.png><p>You’re choosing yourself, and taking a step back from the day-to-day hustle. After all, with the moon renewing itself in the heart-centered sign of Leo—your 12th house of closure, inhibitions, secrets and unconscious patterns—the need to rest and recharge becomes all the more relevant to you at this time. Otherwise, if you’ve been craving more alone time, or perhaps entertaining the thought of participating in mystical pursuits, this an excellent time to do so. The best part? Both Mars and your celestial ruler, Mercury, are transiting your sign, which is always fitting for themes of wellness, and mindfulness. The only catch is that the new moon will be at odds with disruptive Uranus, raising unexpected questions around your belief systems. Don’t jump to conclusions, and be sure to keep an open mind instead.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.8649635036496><h2>Libra</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Libra.png><p>How can you continue to cultivate your talents and abilities for the greater good? This is especially significant to consider with the moon renewing itself in show-stopping Leo, bringing new beginnings to your socially conscious 11th house of associations, community affairs and individual freedom. Keep in mind, your celestial ruler, Venus, has been retrograde in this area of your chart since July, adding a layer of reflection and re-evaluation to your new-moon moment. Are you still in alignment with your friendship groups? Do you feel supported within your community? Your long term goals and dreams could also be under review, but the new moon’s square to Uranus is helping you break free from what no longer serves you. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.3252885624344><h2>Scorpio</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Scorpio.png><p>Everyone deserves an opportunity to do what they love for a living, and you’re no exception. Luna will renew itself in Leo, bringing new energies and potentials to your 10th house of career, reputation and notoriety. That said, Venus has been transiting this area of your chart since July, so chances are you’ve been reassessing and re-evaluating everything from your professional partnerships to your unique value systems. Are you genuinely fulfilled in this area of your life? Otherwise, have you been tapping into your talents and abilities, and maximizing your potential in the public eye? A new chapter awaits, but while at odds with Uranus in your relationship sector, some of you might run into some unexpected chaos with a significant other.

So, what’s stopping you from taking the lead? There will be a new moon in your sister-sign, Leo, touching down on your expansive ninth house of travel, education, higher learning, and self-discovery. But is this dream worth the risk? Being ruled by Jupiter makes you a teacher at heart, but this lunation is also presenting you with opportunities and energies needed to relay these messages of wisdom to the rest of the world. Be it through travel or perhaps entrepreneurship, the possibilities are endless, Sagittarius. While at odds with Uranus, however, this new beginning will likely bring shake-ups to your day-to-day routine, but with the support of Mars-Mercury in Virgo—via your 10th house of reputation and authority—you will have the mental stamina and focus to get the job done. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.2457716701903><h2>Capricorn</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Capricorn.png><p>You prefer to take the lead with your investments, and this is actually one of your most admirable qualities. Whether personally or in terms of business, this month’s new moon in Leo will bring new energies and potentials to your eighth house of intimacy, mergers, joint ventures, and shared resources. Now, given that Venus has been retrograde in this area of your chart for almost a month now, you’re no stranger to the financial and/or relationship themes that are being brought to your attention at this time. To commit, or not to commit, that is the question. In the meantime, the moon will face off with change-maker Uranus, triggering a shocking and unexpected change of heart, so try to tread lightly before going all in.

Luna will renew itself in celebratory Leo, bringing new beginnings and potentials to your harmony-seeking seventh house of compromise, agreements, and significant others. What have you discovered about your relationship dynamics since July? Personally or professionally, you’re being gifted with a brand-new beginning, and clean slate in this area of life. On a more erratic note, however, the new moon will face off with your modern ruler, Uranus. This is where unexpected shake-ups in the homefront (and/or your personal life) could somehow influence your decision-making process.

Be it via a creative endeavor in the workplace, or a new habit that evokes the bold leader within you, there is fertility and vitality surrounding your day-to-day affairs at this time. Venus has been retrograde in this area of your chart since mid-July, so you might’ve already started reassessing things, specifically when it comes to your values, relationships and finances. If you’re still unsure about next steps, this lunation will more than likely bring it to your attention, as it will square Uranus in your third house of communication, and mental processes.
