His public engagements have been postponed for a short period.</p><p>“In common with thousands of men each year, The King has sought treatment for an enlarged prostate,” the palace said in a statement. “His Majesty’s condition is benign and he will attend hospital next week for a corrective procedure. The King’s public engagements will be postponed for a short period of recuperation.”</p><p>According to the NHS, benign prostate enlargement is a common <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">condition</a> in men aged over 50, which affects how a person urinates. The prostate is a small gland located between the penis and bladder. When it becomes enlarged, it can place pressure on the bladder, thus affecting one’s urination.</p><p>It is not a cancer and usually does not pose a serious threat to <a href=#>health</a>. There are concerns that an enlarged prostate correlates to an increased risk of prostate cancer, which is untrue. Most cases do not require surgery.</p><p>The <a href=#>royals</a>‘ exact procedure is unknown but treatments may be surgery to remove part of the prostate gland, or using lasers or steam to destroy prostate tissue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1368479050-1024x776.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kate-middleton-hospitalized-for-abdominal-surgery>Kate Middleton hospitalized for abdominal surgery</h2><p>Two hours before the King’s news, Kensington Palace issued a statement regarding Kate’s latest health condition.</p><p>“Her Royal Highness The Princess of Wales was admitted to The London Clinic yesterday for planned abdominal surgery,” they said.</p><p>“The surgery was successful and it is expected that she will remain in hospital for 10 to 14 days, before returning home to continue her recovery.”</p><p>Further details about the condition were not disclosed but it is understood not to be cancer-related. Middleton will return to public engagements after Easter.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2aEcLfIp55mm5iWv62x0manpZmeqHqxu9Ktp6imlZl6or%2BMoZysZaOawW7Azmasp5yVp7SweceoqqmhpJa5brzRqJqenKWnsnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
