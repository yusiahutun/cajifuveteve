And because every personality type is represented, it’s time to discuss the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Sex and the City character that matches each zodiac sign</a>. You know you’ve spent countless hours wondering if you’re a Carrie, a Samantha, a Charlotte, or a Miranda, so why not bring astrology into the equation?</p><p>While it may not be that shocking to see sex discussed so plainly on TV these days, it was groundbreaking <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>when it happened on Sex and the City</a>. It premiered in 1998, a time when it was still considered taboo for women to talk about—and actually enjoy—sex. Since its subsequent revival And Just Like That… started making waves and all 6 seasons were recently uploaded onto Netflix, members of Generation Z have finally been exploring the controversial world of Carrie Bradshaw and her long list of lovers. However, what you’ll come to find is that the real “love of her life” was never a man; it was her three best friends—Charlotte, Miranda, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>and Samantha</a>. Even if you find some of the show’s topics and innuendos somewhat dated by today’s standards, you have to admit that its emphasis on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the importance of female friendship</a> will always stand the test of time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=the-sex-and-the-city-character-that-matches-each-zodiac-sign>The Sex and the City Character That Matches Each Zodiac Sign</h2><p>Many of us have spent hours debating <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the zodiac signs of each character</a>. And while we technically actually know the fictional birthdays of the main four, it’s important to remember how multifaceted astrology can be, making these conversations quite subjective. Here’s my take on what each Sex and the City character’s zodiac sign would be:</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Aries: You’re Jack Berger</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/jack-berger-1920-copy.jpg><p>If anyone is gonna break up with you through a Post-it note, I wouldn’t be one bit surprised if it was an Aries. Despite how much Aries is associated with conflict, they’re famous for ghosting once they’ve lost interest. If an Aries isn’t feeling totally passionate about something—or someone—they’d like to move on as quickly and cleanly as possible, just like Jack Berger. However, he does capture the way an Aries takes a lot of pride in their work, as Jack Berger is a writer who couldn’t help but feel insulted when Carrie made fun of his protagonist for wearing a scrunchie in Manhattan.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.5><h2>Taurus: You’re Samantha Jones</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1_h10na-aR17u03ml-V6Lcpg.jpeg><p>If anyone lives for the finer things in life, it’s Samantha Jones. Taurus is ruled by Venus—planet of sensuality, pleasure, and money—which explains why Samantha only prioritizes things that make her feel good. Not only is she a sexually empowered woman, but she also works hard in her career as a publicist. However, she’s also willing to cancel her afternoon appointments to masturbate for hours and will never hesitate to treat herself to something expensive. When Samantha told Smith Jerrod “I love you, but I love me more,” she was crowning herself a Taurus queen. She’s also an incredibly loyal friend, just like every Taurus.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Gemini: You're Carrie Bradshaw</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Carrie-Bradshaw.Sex-and-the-City.webp?w=650"><p>Famous for her edgy one-liners and infamous for her controversial taste in men, Carrie Bradshaw is a Gemini through and through. While she yearns for the taste of love and romance, she also prefers her freedom and independence. As a freelance journalist with a sex column, Carrie’s curiosity about the sex lives of women in Manhattan is the epitome of a Gemini who has many questions. She’s someone who can listen to your problems and give you the best insight in the world, but like every Gemini, she herself has a hard time following her own advice.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.5><h2>Cancer: You’re Aidan Shaw</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Aidan-shaw-1024.webp?w=650"><p>Sweet, emotional, and sentimental Aidan Shaw could be nothing less than a Cancer. From the jump, he made it clear to Carrie that he only wants to sleep with someone he actually has feelings for. Cancers are deeply passionate and romantic, but only when they actually care about someone. He wanted to court Carrie, build a home with her, and start a family together. While so many characters in Sex and the City became jaded by the Manhattan dating scene, Aidan always maintained his belief in love, even when he was totally heartbroken. A Cancer could never give up on love.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Leo: You’re Smith Jerrod</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/hop-skip-and-a-week-04-1024_zps37c273cd.webp?w=650"><p>Leos have a way of attracting all the attention in the room. And while actor Smith Jerrod was working at a restaurant, he had a flock of female patrons making their reservations just so he could be their server. Samantha was so taken with him that she decided to manage him when he was a “nobody”, eventually taking his career to the next level by inviting every executive in town to see his play. But Smith Jerrod is more than just a pretty face and a hot body, because he’s also the most generous, committed, and thoughtful lover Samantha ever had. When he shaved his head to support Samantha during her round of chemotherapy, Smith displayed all the glorious qualities of a Leo in love.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Virgo: You’re Anthony Marentino</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screen-Shot-2024-04-02-at-2.28.44-PM.png><p>Anthony Marentino is the best wedding planner in Manhattan (and for good reason). Despite being a fun-loving and fashion-forward gay man, he runs his business like a military sergeant with goals to meet. Getting it right is like life or death for a Virgo, and Anthony is no different. He’s always in a rush, always expecting perfection, and he’s never afraid to tell you how terrible you look. When he saw that Carrie wanted to wear a thrifted pantsuit for her wedding to Mr. Big, he immediately said “the bride wore a dress by no one,” putting his brutal Virgo honesty right on display.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Libra: You’re Charlotte York</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/JK94Fp9h26Q3w3T3opnQkU.jpeg><p>No one is more in love with love than Charlotte York. When she was crying and telling her friends “I’ve been dating since I was 15, where is he?!” she made it known that she must have Libra in her birth chart somewhere. Libra is the zodiac sign of love, friendship, and marriage, which often means they dream of finding their one true love from the beginning. However, Charlotte is more than just a hopeless romantic, but someone who has a very firm understanding of what they deem right or wrong. She has strong opinions about what love is—and what it isn’t—which captures the way Libras are always weighing the pros and cons.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Scorpio: You’re Mr. Big</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screen-Shot-2024-04-02-at-2.35.34-PM.png><p>Behind the passion and intensity seen in Big’s eyes is a treasure trove of secrets. And of all the signs in the zodiac, none are more covert and mysterious than Scorpio. The audience doesn’t even find out that his real name is John Preston until season 6, emphasizing the fact that none of us—not even Carrie—will ever fully understand the infamous Mr. Big. Scorpio is the zodiac sign of strategy and investments, which makes sense, as Big’s first love is his highly successful career in finance. He can be hot and cold—just like your typical Scorpio man—and just when Carrie thinks he’s finally settled down, he surprises her with what he does next. Being in a relationship with a complicated Scorpio man is basically a right of passage for a straight woman, and in Sex and the City, it’s the main romantic storyline.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.5><h2>Sagittarius: You’re Harry Goldenblatt</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/harry-goldenblatt-1920.webp?w=650"><p>On the surface, Harry Goldenblatt may appear like a stiff and somewhat boring lawyer, but Charlotte makes it clear that he’s a freak in the sheets. After her divorce with a man who couldn’t “get it up”, Harry rocks Charlotte’s world after admitting that he’s massively attracted to her. Sagittarians always find a way to shoot their shot, as they are ruled by the archer in astrology. And despite the fact that Charlotte may have been “out of his league”, he pointed his arrow right at Charlotte and won her over. Always uplifting, funny, and ready for a good time, his Sagittarius energy was exactly what Charlotte always needed.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.5><h2>Capricorn: You’re Miranda Hobbes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screen-Shot-2024-04-02-at-3.03.38-PM.png><p>Capricorn folk are ambitious, head-strong, and more than capable of being a provider, which is Miranda Hobbes to a T. Not only is she a successful lawyer who can take care of herself, but she’s not here to waste time with partners who are jerks, which is why she has no problem cutting them loose. Her determined nature can come across as sarcastic and judgmental, but that’s usually because she’s the smartest person in the room. And despite how cold, stoic, and blunt they appear on the surface, Capricorns are always soft and sentimental at heart. This is shown in Miranda’s undying love for her cat, her besties, and of course, her son Brady.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6><h2>Aquarius: You’re Stanford Blatch</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/stanford-blatch-1920.jpeg><p>Aquarius is the zodiac sign of community, friendship, and eccentricities, which perfectly encapsulates Stanford Blatch. He’s the unofficial fifth member of Carrie, Charlotte, Samantha, and Miranda’s clique, and no matter how ridiculous the situation may be, he’s always up for a night out with his favorite girls. Like every Aquarius, his outfits are always incredibly unique and innovative. Sweet, friendly, and highly fashionable, Stanford captures the side of Aquarius who may be a shy and little offbeat, but knows how to befriend everyone in the room (even the bitchiest person in attendance).</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4><h2>Pisces: You're Steve Brady</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Steve-Brady.Sex-and-the-City.webp?w=650"><p>Not only is Steve Brady the most sensitive of all the male love interests on Sex and the City, but he may even be the most empathetic character on the show period. He’s the only one who could thaw Miranda’s icy and somewhat unromantic heart, and between his love for his dog, his son, and his mother, Steve is a Pisces through and through. This water sign is both sentimental and laidback, and while Steve may be highly sensitive, he never lets his emotions get in the way of his positive outlook on life. When Miranda wanted to get up early for work, Steve always made her late with his desire for cuddles and early morning sex. If that man is not a Pisces, I don’t know who is.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfr7yltcCcZKyhl6PAbr%2FEsWSappRiwamxjJygrbFf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
