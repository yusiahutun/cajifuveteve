The Yorkshire lass told us: &#34;I showed my mum one of the first pictures I had taken as Alicia.
&#34;The first thing she noticed was the size of my boobs, which wasn't hard because they're humongous."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Alicia is someone who needs to feel womanly and what better way to do that than show off a great chest.</p><p>"So I wear a padded bra with two ‘chicken fillets' sewn into each side.

You just have to love what God gave you."</p><p>Nat, 28, who played naughty Nurse Stella Davenport in ITV1's The Royal, has been happily wed to financial adviser James Shepherd for two years.</p><p>But the loved-up pair lived apart for almost a year while she starred in hit West End musical Wicked.</p><p>So when they got the call saying she had got the part of Alicia, Natalie couldn't wait to come home.</p><p>She said: "I've always loved Emmerdale and I can actually see the hills in the opening credits from my house.</p><p>"It was hard being away from James while I was in Wicked but he's always been so supportive of everything I do."</p><p>While her own domestic life is rosy, the same can't be said for her character Alicia.</p><p>Nat said: "Alicia is bound to get judged straight away because of the way she dresses.
