The Bewitched actress chose to ignore the chilly weather with her backless gown, that showed off her toned figure. The dress was the centerpiece of her entire look, and we’re low-key obsessed.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nicole-kidman-steals-the-show-at-expats-premiere>Nicole Kidman steals the show at Expats premiere</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1943416944-683x1024.jpg><p>The structured dress, which featured a cowl neck, slim straps and a floor length skirt with a high thigh slit, oozed elegance. It’s something only <a href=#>fashion</a> designers could dream up.</p><p>So when Nicole Kidman came walking down the Expats Red Carpet, she knew she’d turn heads.</p><p>The 56-year-old let her natural hair down, with the auburn wavy locks cascading over her shoulder with a middle part. She chose simple accessories with the look to ensure her dress was the show-stopper. Pairing the black dress with simple diamond drop earrings, silver watch and bangle. To finish it off, she wore pointy black stilettos.</p><p>What an icon.</p><p>She recently spoke out against her <a href=#>greatest insecurity,</a> her height, where she said she hated wearing heels at award shows. The <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star feared she would be seen as the ‘giraffe’ on the Red Carpet. But we love the <a href=#>celebrity</a> is throwing her anxiety to the side to enjoy the moment in her killer heels.</p><p>Expats, from Amazon Prime Video, is based on a Janice YK Lee novel called The Expatriates. It’s set to release on January 26 on the streaming giant, following a group of professionals living in Hong Kong.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-hollywood-star-doesn-t-mind-rocking-the-boat>Hollywood star doesn’t mind rocking the boat</h2><p><a href=#>Movie</a> stars are often subject to harsh criticism over their wardrobe, whether on a magazine cover or at events. Nicole Kidman caused a stir before her Expats premiere, last year. She invited debate over her <a href=#>Vanity Fair micro-skirt</a> look she chose for the 2022 cover.</p><p>It caused a buzz online, but she hasn’t let the reaction get the best of her.</p><p>She later admitted over the incident: “I make the most random, crazy choices. I call it ‘teenage choices’ because I don’t ever think of the consequences.”</p><p>But she wants to continue to be fearless, otherwise she’d feel too ‘scared or worried about what people think’.</p><p>Nicole Kidman went on to explain she doesn’t read into fan reactions, or it’ll spoil it.</p><p>She added: “Don’t tell me. I don’t want to know. It’ll stop me from doing what I want to do”.</p><p>We think she’s got it right.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2d%2FcLrInKalnV2gtqW5wKeqZpyRp7avs4ybmJyjnJrAtHnDq5ysq12ewG6tjKyfqK%2BjqbyxvMSrZJqsXZrFsa3TrGSpqpWitqa%2BxGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
