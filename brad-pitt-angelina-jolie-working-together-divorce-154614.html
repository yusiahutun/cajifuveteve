With magnificent aromas of fragrant white blossom and fruit, the wine retains that touch of distinctive minerality drawn from the limestone soils, that is the hallmark of the greatest French terrors.”</p><p>“But what makes this 2017 vintage really stand out is its silky texture which adds a very special dimension to the wine,” he added. The Miravel region in France has been thrust into the spotlight since Brad and Angelina bought their property there a decade ago. It has since attracted interest from fellow wine-interested celebrities, notably George Lucas. He bought the property adjacent to Brangelina’s to add to his Skywalker Vineyard Collection. Maybe it’s time to invest in the wine business, anyone have a spare $100 million?</p><p>This post was written by Georgia Aspinall.
