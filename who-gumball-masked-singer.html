Throughout the season, a panel of judges guess who the celebrities are based on their voices and clues provided before and after each performance. Each week, the contestant with the least amount of votes from a studio audience is sent home and takes off their mask to reveal their identity.</p><p><a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/the-masked-singer-cast-season-11/ rel="noreferrer noopener">The Masked Singer</a> is based on South Korea’s King of the Mask Singer, which follows a similar format. Since the premiere of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The King of the Mask Singer</a> in 2015, The Masked Singer has expanded to dozens of countries across the world including France, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Brazil.&nbsp;“It was flypaper TV right from the get-go,” <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Masked Singer</a> executive producer Craig Plestis told <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a> in 2019 about why he wanted to produce the show in the United States. “I just knew right away this was a special show. It was unbelievable in its appeal — and the game play, spectacle, family-viewing…[and] it was this huge hit in Asia…. If we do the job here, it should work here.”</p><p>The Masked Singer premiered in 2019 with host Nick Cannon and judges Jenny McCarthy, Ken Jeong, Robin Thicke, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1687129/why-nicole-scherzinger-leave-the-masked-singer/>Nicole Scherzinger.

It’s just so crazy and it’s like a huge game show, and such a great family show. You can’t really go wrong. I mean, you may look crazy with the names you [guess], but who cares? Because the whole show is a bit bonkers anyway, so it doesn’t feel like work at all.”</p><p>Throughout The Masked Singer‘s 10-plus seasons, dozens of celebrities, including LeeAnn Rimes, Jesse McCartney, Gladys Knight, Donny Osmond, and T-Pain, have competed on the show under secret identities and complex costumes.
