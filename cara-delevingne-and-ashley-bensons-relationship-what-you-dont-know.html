Last we heard, Benson was ready to settle down, but things have taken a devastating turn. Can someone please tell us why we feel so personally invested in this couple?</p><p>According to <a href=#>People</a>, the <a href=#>actresses broke up in April 2020</a> after nearly two years of dating. "Cara and Ashley always had their ups and down before but it's over now," an anonymous source claimed to the magazine.&nbsp;"Their relationship just ran its course." Meanwhile,&nbsp;another insider cited by <a href=#>Life & Style</a> alleged that breakup wasn't "surprising" to the former couple's friends, because they had reportedly been having "problems." This second source added,&nbsp;"No one wanted it to be true. They were great together — a dynamic duo — and everyone loved having them around. That's why this is so hard."</p><p>Delevingne's reportedly been leaning on her friends post-split and hanging out with Rainey Qualley, Margaret Qualley, and Kaia Gerber, per People. Meanwhile, Benson has been&nbsp;<a href=#>bored</a> in the house. At the time of this writing, neither party has confirmed the breakup. What's going to happen to the tattoos Benson and Delevingne got in each other's honor? At the very least, it seems like they're still friends, considering Benson posted a TikTok of Delevingne on<a href=#>&nbsp;Instagram</a>&nbsp;just weeks before their split.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmam5gboR6e8KaqZpllJq5psLIp56nnV2Wu6V5wKyfpZ2pYq%2BmutKopaxlopq5osDIqKWsoJmleri0wK1ksqelYrGwutNmoqenp2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
