Below, the true story of that devastating 1988 incident.</p><h2 data-node-id=1 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Where did the accident happen?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In March of 1988, Prince Charles and Princess Diana were on one of their regular skiing holidays with friends at Klosters, a notoriously exclusive resort in the Swiss Alps. On March 10, Charles was skiing on a famously difficult slope on Gotschnagrat Mountain. Per <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1988/mar/11/monarchy.fromthearchive data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Guardian" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Guardian</a>'s reporting at the time, the mountain's slopes are "amongst the steepest in Switzerland and are rarely open to the general public ... they are regarded as suitable only for experienced skiers like Prince Charles."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Charles was accompanied on the slopes that day by a mountain guide, Bruno Sprecher, and by a group of friends that included Major Hugh Lindsay, a former equerry to the queen, Charles, and Patti Palmer-Tomkinson, and a Swiss police officer. While the group was "in a stationary position off-piste—meaning they were away from the prepared ski runs—an avalanche happened.<br></p><img alt="major hugh lindsay" title="Major Hugh Lindsay" width=4096 height=2731 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/major-hugh-lindsay-equerry-to-the-queen-news-photo-1605926549.?resize=640:*" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">PA - PA Images</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How did Hugh Lindsay die?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1988/mar/11/monarchy.fromthearchive data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Buckingham Palace's account" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Buckingham Palace's account</a> at the time, the avalanche began above the group, who were able to take cover. But Hugh Lindsay and Patti Palmer-Tomkinson were caught in a sudden snow slide, which had built up afresh during heavy snowfall the day before. Palmer-Tomkinson suffered severe leg injuries, while Lindsay was thrown 400 meters down the mountainside and buried by snow.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Princes Charles and the other members of the group weren't injured, and they tried frantically to dig their injured friends out. Per the BBC, "As soon as the danger had passed, Prince Charles, the guide and a Swiss police officer, who was skiing with the party, raced back to help the victims, digging with their bare hands in the snow to reach them."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/10/newsid_2566000/2566699.stm data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sprecher administered mouth-to-mouth resuscitation" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Sprecher administered mouth-to-mouth resuscitation</a> to Palmer-Tomkinson while they waited for help to arrive, and Charles would later credit him with saving her life. Lindsay and Palmer-Tomkinson were helicoptered to a hospital in the nearby town of Davos, but Lindsay was pronounced dead on arrival.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lindsay was just 34 years old, and was expecting a baby at the time with his wife, Sarah, who worked in the Buckingham Palace press office. After serving as the queen's equerry for a few years in the 1980s, he returned to full-time army duties in 1986.</p><img alt="prince charles, princess diana and sarah ferguson, duchess of york, return to england with the coffin of their friend major hugh lindsay" title="Prince Charles Back To UK" width=5386 height=3649 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/prince-charles-princess-diana-and-sarah-ferguson-duchess-of-news-photo-1605926412.?resize=640:*" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Georges De Keerle</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How did Prince Charles react?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Charles was, understandably, devastated by the death of his friend. An eyewitness told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/10/newsid_2566000/2566699.stm data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the BBC" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">the BBC</a>: "He looked very distressed, somebody said he was crying, but he did walk to the helicopter so he looked uninjured."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Charles did eventually return to Klosters, visiting with his sons William and Harry several times during the 1990s. Diana, though, never went back to the resort after the tragedy, per <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/articles/was-prince-charles-caught-in-an-avalanche-the-crown/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Telegraph" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Telegraph</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Andrew Morton described Diana's response to the tragedy in his 1992 biography Diana: Her True Story – In Her Own Words. Diana and Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, had stayed behind at the chalet on March 10, and were informed by a courtier that there had been an accident on the slopes. Morton wrote:</p>For what seemed like an eternity, the Princess and her sister-in-law sat at the top of the stairs, hardly daring to breathe let alone move, as they waited anxiously for more news. Shortly afterwards Prince Charles, sounding shocked and distressed, rang and told Philip Mackie that he was all right, but Major Hugh Lindsay... had been killed. Everyone started shaking in the first paroxysms of grief.<p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Morton also describes how Diana managed Charles in the days following the shock, and most notably how she talked him out of returning to the slopes:</p>The prince was not immediately convinced that they should abandon their holiday but Diana prevailed. She appreciated that he was suffering from shock and could not at that awful time comprehend the enormity of the tragedy. For once Diana felt absolutely in command of a very trying situation. In fact she was quite bossy, telling the Prince that it was their responsibility to return to Britain with Hugh's body.<p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The group did indeed cut their holiday short, and returned to the U.K. with the body on March 12. "The whole thing was ghastly," Diana recalled in her interview with Morton, "and what a nice person he was. Out of all the people who went it should never have been him."</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/8672d2dc-5b2b-4ad4-bbfb-fd434da819c6.jpg alt="Headshot of Emma Dibdin" title="Headshot of Emma Dibdin" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Emma Dibdin is a freelance writer based in Los Angeles who writes about culture, mental health, and true crime.
