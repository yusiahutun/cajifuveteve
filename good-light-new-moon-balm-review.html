I've dealt with hormonal breakouts since college and I've even taken <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>spironolactone</a> to help get my skin under control.

Needless to say, the lower half of my face was covered with acne at the beginning of the pandemic in the spring and summer of 2020. I started back at square one, and while I have since gotten my breakouts back under control, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>I still get a few blemishes</a> from wearing a mask and at certain stages in my cycle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One product that's helped speed up the healing process of my blemishes is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Good Light's New Moon Balm</a>. The formula is stacked with a plethora of soothing, nourishing, and calming ingredients, like panthenol, allantoin, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin E, to reduce the aftermath of blemishes. (Think redness, hyperpigmentation, and dryness.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the spot treatment is supposed to be used post-blemish, I rely on it throughout the entirety of a pimple's life cycle. I've found it helps pimples go down faster and minimizes any redness, which makes them easier to cover with concealer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Most importantly, it doesn't dry out my skin like other spot treatments, which usually results in a flaky patch that is only further accentuated by my complexion products. I've even taken to using it on bacne caused by my sweaty ponytail brushing against my shoulders during spin classes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: The Best Skincare Routine for Acne, According to Dermatologists</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Good Light also suggests using New Moon as a cuticle salve and a soothing treatment for sunburns, post-waxing, chafing, shaving, and dry lips. And given that most of these things are side effects of summer, I plan on trying it on all of the above. If only the tube were bigger.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From non-toxic makeup and skincare to sustainability practices, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Clean Slate</a> is an exploration of all things in the green beauty space.
