The pair dazzled millions of fans with trendy looks, lifestyle, and romance.&nbsp;</p><p>Another thing the two women had in common was their past relationship with former child star Aaron Carter. Basically, their relationship dynamics ended up in a love triangle that turned messy. Here’s all the tea from the 2000s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/messy-love-triangle.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=aaron-carter-s-puppy-love-with-hilary-duff-and-lindsay-lohan><span class=ez-toc-section id=Aaron_Carters_Puppy_Love_With_Hilary_Duff_And_Lindsay_Lohan></span>Aaron Carter’s Puppy Love With Hilary Duff And Lindsay Lohan<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Aaron Carter and Hilary Duff met in 2000 on Duff’s Disney series, “Lizzie McGuire.” At the time, Carter, who was a teenage music star, made a guest appearance on the show. He and Duff kicked it off right from the start and were soon dating.</p><p>The duo was an adorable teen couple that fascinated their teenage fanbase. However, the relationship was more on an on-and-off basis until they finally called it off one year and six months later.&nbsp;</p><p>Once speaking about his relationship with Duff, Carter told CNBC that he <a href=#>got bored</a> after dating her for over a year and soon started talking to “Parent Trap” star Lindsay Lohan.&nbsp;</p><p>This happened to be the catalyst for Carter and Duff’s breakup, but they got back together again, and by 2003, they were done for good. The “I’m All About You” singer was said to have cheated on Duff, but not with Lohan.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/aaron-duff.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=the-girls-were-involved-in-a-feud><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Girls_Were_Involved_In_A_Feud></span>The Girls Were Involved In A Feud<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>By the time Carter was done circling back and forth with the star actresses, they had brewed <a href=#>animosity</a> towards each other. Soon enough, fans noticed the silent wars between Lohan and Duff.</p><p>Lohan targeted Hilary Duff’s movies, and it was a mutual feeling. They popped up at each other’s movie premieres, which was quite a handful because they were cast in several movies. Duff took to the red carpet at the premiere of Lindsay’s movie, “Freaky Friday.”</p><p>Lohan had a payback moment when she waltzed into the premiere of “Cheaper By The Dozen.” It was also reported that Lohan called Chad Murray, Duff’s co-lead actor, on “A Cinderella Story” to say terrible things about her.</p><p>The jabs between the ladies soon turned public and viral when Lohan appeared on “Total Request Live.” When asked about the one thing on her mind that she would love to get out, Lohan memorably said, “I love you, Hilary Duff.”&nbsp;</p><p>Lohan fired another jab at her fellow teen star at <a href=#>SNL</a> when she made a caricature of Duff’s style choice. Hilary would later respond in an interview with Access Hollywood. She <a href=#>shared</a>:</p><p>“I’m not here to talk bad about her like she talks bad about me all the time.”</p><p>Duff’s retaliation included her reportedly banning Lohan from attending the premiere of “A Cinderella Story.” She also stated in a <a href=#>Blender Magazine</a> interview that she hated Lohan sometimes.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/aaron-lindsay.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=carter-declared-his-love-for-hilary-yet-again><span class=ez-toc-section id=Carter_Declared_His_Love_For_Hilary_Yet_Again></span>Carter Declared His Love For Hilary Yet Again<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Years after their puppy love and romance drama ended, Carter took to his social media page, opening up <a href=#>about his love</a> for the actress in a series of tweets.&nbsp;</p><p>This had been in 2014, and he shared a tweet alluding to his old-time relationship with Duff. he also pointed out how he did not treat her right and would love to make things right.</p><p>In an <a href=#>interview with ET</a>, Cater talked about how they had drifted apart and did not know much about each other anymore. However, he added that if he got a chance to, he would “sweep her off her feet” and fix what he did wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Duff, who has since moved on with her love life, had a different opinion. The same year, Duff, 34, joined Andy Cohen on “Watch What Happens Live” and shared that she did not know how to feel about Carter’s declarations.&nbsp;</p><p>She also <a href=#>clarified</a> that their romance was way back when she was thirteen. Duff emphasized that she has moved past all of that and was married with a kid.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=did-duff-and-lohan-end-their-feud><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Duff_and_Lohan_End_Their_Feud></span>Did Duff and Lohan End Their Feud?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Thankfully, the Lohan and Duff feud started and ended in the 2000s. Once in an interview with <a href=#>People</a> in 2007, the “Santa Claus Lane” actress shared that she had called it quits concerning their tiff. She <a href=#>explained</a>:</p><p>“We are both adults and whatever happened, happened when we were young. It’s over.”</p><p>A week before the interview, the former teen idols proved that they no longer had bad blood when they enjoyed a good time at Hollywood Club Teddy’s. They indulged in the lovely moment reveling in each other’s company.</p><p>Lohan and Duff were seen chatting heartily, and at one point, they kissed each other’s hands. Lohan supported Duff and showed up for her album release party in the same year.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kwamxjKacrKupYrmwwsRmq6uhkaO0rbGMm5ytr5Wau264yKebrJmpYrmwtMCnZKGhnJa%2FunnDrp2fZZGjsW6twKump2WTlr%2B1sdFo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
