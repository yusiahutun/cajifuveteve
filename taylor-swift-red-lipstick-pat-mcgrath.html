If there’s one makeup trend Taylor Swift absolutely owns, it’s a red lip. She rocks this bold color quite literally everywhere—from red carpets and music videos to her concerts and even while strolling down the street. And if it’s Taylor Swift’s signature look, we of course have to get to the bottom of which exact lipstick is responsible for her iconic pout."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She rocks this bold color quite literally everywhere—from red carpets and music videos to her concerts and even while strolling down the street.

The thing is, Taylor is typically pretty secretive about her fave beauty products. Fortunately, Pat McGrath is no gatekeeper. The makeup artist and CEO and founder of <a href=# id=auto-tag_pat-mcgrath-labs data-tag=pat-mcgrath-labs>Pat McGrath Labs</a> spilled all of Taylor’s fave products from the brand.&nbsp;</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/anua-cleansing-oil-tiktok.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg><p>We’re specifically talking about the products used in the singer’s “Bejeweled” music video. Taylor’s striking <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">red lip</a> is to die for. So which Pat product is she wearing? She’s serving look after look in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LiquiLUST: Legendary Wear Matte Lipstick</a> in shade Elson 4 (which she also wore on the 2022 VMAs red carpet).</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Now this selection doesn’t come as a huge shock to us since the makeup artist did fans a huge solid and bundled Taylor’s faves into special <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>‘Taylor-Made’ kits</a>. The lip-specific set, along with the lipstick in Elson 4, has sold out on the brand’s site in the past, so you’re going to want to make a mad dash to <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Sephora</a> to nab the LiquiLUST: Legendary Wear Matte Lipstick.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/pat-mcgrath-labs-liquilist-legendary-wear-matte-lipstick-sephora.png><p>Now let’s get into what makes this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">red lipstick</a> so good that it earned a rare stamp of approval from Taylor herself. First off, it’s a <a href=# id=auto-tag_liquid-lipstick data-tag=liquid-lipstick>liquid lipstick</a>, but not like the ones that leave your pout dry and crusty. This Pat formula is lightweight, velvety and comfortable to wear. Not to mention, it gives you a smooth, soft matte finish that lasts for up to 12 hours. It has such great lasting power also because it’s smudge- and transfer-proof.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LiquiLUST: Legendary Wear Matte Lipstick</a> feels like a “second skin,” according to the brand, and that’s because the formula uses a proprietary stretch effect. Simply swipe the applicator along your lips for a super-saturated look. The teardrop shape of the brush allows you to line, fill and blend the product to perfection.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s no wonder Taylor keeps gliding this lipstick on, but let’s hear what Sephora shoppers are saying, too. The product has earned a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">4.6-star overall rating</a>, which is quite impressive if you ask us.&nbsp;</p><p>“I wore this all day today as a wear test for the Taylor Swift Eras Tour, and let me tell you, this lipstick is amazing,” raved one Swiftie. “I am nine hours into my day and I haven’t had to reapply at all and it hasn’t moved. Love it!”</p><p>“I’ve been lusting after Pat McGrath’s makeup and when my trusted red finally hit pan, I knew it was time. Y’ALL. Throw away all of your red lippies, this is the one,” another one wrote. “It slides on thick and matte and dries quickly, though there is a light smudge (NOT transfer!) that can happen if you’re not careful.”</p><p>The verdict is in: Pat McGrath Lab’s LiquiLUST: Legendary Wear Matte Lipstick in Elson 4 is everything and more. Shimmy on over to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sephora</a> and add this lipstick to your cart so you can twin with Taylor ASAP. And if you’re going to her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Eras Tour</a>, you should definitely put some pep in your step before the lipstick sells out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLqit8Sup2hpZmWFc4CSaKuasZykv26%2F1qKdrWWimrFuuMipqq2hk6B6sa3TZqScn6KWwal7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
