But if you're looking to take your setup to the next level, adding widgets is the easiest way to go. Here are some of the best Notion widgets you can try today.</p><h2 id=aura-clock-widget>1. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aura Clock Widget</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/aura-notion-clock.jpg><p>If you are someone who glances at the time on your laptop whenever you use Notion, having a bigger clock right on your Notion page is a good idea.

You can change the colors of this widget to match your color palette.</p><h2 id=aesthetic-pomodoro-timer>5. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aesthetic Pomodoro Timer</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/aesthetic-pomodoro-timer-notion-widget.jpg><p>Pomodoro is a time management technique, where you work for a specific length of time (typically 25 minutes) before taking a break (usually for five minutes).</p><p>If you are already using this method, you will be glad to know that you no longer need to set the timer on your phone; just use this Pomodoro timer widget on Notion.

You'll have a choice of different relaxing sounds like fire, rain, waves, coffee shop, and singing bowl.</p><p>The best part about this Notion widget is that you can mix and match the sounds however you like.

However, note that this embedded playlist wouldn't really play the songs in full. You can only listen to a sampler. The playlist is more like a decoration for your page and an easy way to get to the Spotify website (you only have to click the logo on the embed).</p><h2 id=calculator>11. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Calculator</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/shoroukaziz-calculator-notion-widget.jpg><p>You may think that you have no use for a calculator on your Notion page. But there will always come a time when you need to do a quick calculation, and you're too lazy to open up your phone. It's best to add this aesthetic calculator widget to your budget tracker page, where you will most likely need numbers assistance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=schedule-builder>12. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Schedule Builder</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/schedule-builder.jpg><p>Not everyone's into the whole aesthetic vibe when it comes to habit trackers and schedule builders. If you're more of a fan of simplicity, like a throwback to the good ol' 90s, you will appreciate the Schedule Builder widget.</p><p>This widget keeps it straightforward. You can create color-coded time blocks with descriptions and a title in a table format. Once you've crafted your ideal week, hit the Share button. Copy that HTML code and turn it into a Notion embeddable URL to add the widget successfully.</p><h2 id=life-progress-bar-by-indify>13.

You can embed multiple photos all at once, and they're neatly arranged in a gallery style that takes up hardly any space.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=simple-countdown>15. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Simple Countdown</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/countdown-widget.jpg><p>A countdown widget can be of great help if you want to have a visual reminder of the time left until a certain event or deadline.
