Despite enhanced quarantine measures at airports, where 160 cases were identified, at least 29 cases of the B. 1.617 variant had been confirmed in Tokyo, Osaka and the prefectures of Hyogo, Chiba and Shizuoka as of this week.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There is also a fear that some cases may have slipped through the net at airports, a concern borne out by several cases among people who had not travelled overseas and had not come into contact with anyone known to be infected.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As a precaution, the governor of Chiba, to the east of Tokyo, announced that he was cancelling the planned Olympic torch relay through the prefecture, which was due to start on July 1. A number of prefectures have altered the route of the relay to avoid busy districts, but Governor Toshihito Kumagai said he was acting “in the best interests of local residents’ safety and security”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2021/05/25/thumbnail_-_clean.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Comments by IOC officials appearing to dismiss Japanese concerns have sparked outrage on social media, including IOC President Thomas Bach telling an International Athletes Forum on Thursday: “Come with full confidence to Tokyo and get ready.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I want to say ‘shut up’,” said one Twitter user. “Let’s beat up on the IOC, which denigrates Japan, and halt these crazy Olympics.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">IOC officials have in recent days reiterated that measures are being taken to ensure the well-being of athletes and officials travelling to Tokyo. However, they are also facing scrutiny over a clause in the entry forms – which all athletes must sign before taking part in Olympics events – stipulating that the organisers of the Games are not liable for any coronavirus issues that might affect individuals while they are in Japan, and attendance is at their own risk.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">SoftBank CEO warns Japan has ‘a lot to lose’ by proceeding with Games</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The committee’s chief operating officer Lana Haddad, speaking from the Swiss city of Lausanne during an online conference on Thursday, said the additional clause “is really to provide transparency and ensure informed consent” from participants.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The entry forms are consistent with the standard practice of all other big event organisers and the forms are within the framework of the law, if I may add,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Novak Djokovic, the world No 1 tennis player, has given organisers another headache by declaring that he will reconsider his plans to take part in the Games if spectators are not permitted to attend matches.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/05/28/388ed30a-bf90-11eb-9b2e-758b3029e26f_1320x770_191953.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">International spectators will not be allowed for the Games but some 90,000 people including athletes and their delegations will be coming. No decision has been made yet on domestic fans.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Several other tennis players – including Rafael Nadal, Serena Williams, and home-grown stars Naomi Osaka and Kei Nishikori – have also expressed reservations about playing in Tokyo.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Domestic politicians are also beginning to speak out against the Olympics, with Kazuo Shii, the leader of the Japanese Communist Party, on Thursday accusing the IOC of treating Japan “like a colony.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Responding to recent declarations by members of the IOC that the Games will go ahead even if the state of emergency is still in place, Shii called for the government to immediately cancel the Games, and said: “It is unforgivable for the IOC to place priority on holding the Games over the lives of Japanese citizens. The ‘IOC Empire’ treats Japan as a colony and violates our sovereignty.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Japan cuts size of foreign Olympics delegations as opposition to Games grows</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The health implications of the Olympics are not the only issue to be causing ill feeling, however, with the South Korean government protesting after a map on the official Olympics website showed the disputed islands of Dokdo – known as Takeshima in Japan – as Japanese territory.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lee Nak-yon, a former South Korean prime minister and chairman of the ruling Democratic Party, in a Facebook post requested that Japan abide by the Olympic Charter’s commitment to political neutrality.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I also urge the IOC to take prompt and stern action against Japan’s move,” said Lee, who is expected to stand in next year’s presidential election. “If Japan continues to refuse, the Korean government should take all possible measures, including a boycott of the Games.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Additional reporting by Reuters</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Flood of bad news mars Games run-up</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZL2wuMitoJyrX5a%2FtbXCpZxoa2FognN%2BlmirqKOppHqwuNimp6Kbo2KyqrPHrWSwnZWgwG6zwKacrGWalr2iuoydnKWZqZ67qHnDmrBmqpWYuLC6yKee</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
