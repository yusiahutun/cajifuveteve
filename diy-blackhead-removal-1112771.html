Thankfully, there are certain experts who actually don’t vouch for self-extractions, one of them being Candace Marino, more popularly known as the LA Facialist."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They don’t open or close, but we can improve their appearance.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kentucky-derby-2.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/buffing-bar.jpg><p>With that being said, let’s get into some preventative “pore protocol,” including ways to nix <a href=# rel=noopener>blackheads</a> without digging into your skin with a tool or device.</p><h2>Start With Identification</h2><p>For starters, make sure that what you’re targeting is actually a blackhead. According to Marino, those “little dots on your nose most likely aren’t blackheads; they’re sebaceous filaments.”</p><p>“Sebaceous filaments are the normal function of the follicle. Narrow, lighter in color under the skin— they do not fully obstruct the pore and are not meant for extractions,” she says.</p><p>“<a href=# rel=noopener>Blackheads</a> will be raised, textured, truly black, thick, and waxy. The skin oils solidify, forming plugs that can dilate the pore further leading to enlarged pores.”</p><h2>Ramp Up Preventative Cleansing</h2><p>Prevention should be your first line of defense against any skin setback, including blackheads. Whether you have a cluster on the tip of your nose or not, Marino recommends regularly using a <a href=# rel=noopener>gentle cleanser</a> with light acids for mild exfoliation, like the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>SkinBetter Oxygen Infusion wash</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/paulas-choice-bha-liquid-exfoliant-1.jpg><p>“Keep the face free from cellular build-up and environmental sludge. Clean pores will always appear smaller so exfoliate daily. <a href=# rel=noopener>Salicylic acid</a> is your friend—use it!,” she adds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bliss-bright-idea-vitamin-c-tripeptide-moisturizer.jpg><h2 class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-title-lg data-transform data-truncate>Bliss Vitamin C + Tri-Peptide Moisturizer</h2><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$21.99</span></p><p>Additionally, aim to strengthen collagen production and elastin with <a href=# rel=noopener>peptides</a>. These miracle workers are compatible with most other skincare ingredients and can be found in everything from <a href=# rel=noopener>eye cream</a> to night serums to your daily <a href=# rel=noopener>moisturizer</a>.</p><h2>Turn Up the Heat</h2><p>In lieu of extraction tools, DIY steaming is both preventative and a gentle, yet effective way to loosen already existing blackheads. Marino only warns that this isn’t recommended for anyone with melasma or <a href=# rel=noopener>hyperpigmentation</a>.</p><p>Her favorite and most cost-effective way to steam is by boiling hot water over the stove, throwing in some tea “to give off spa vibes” and “hovering over the pot with a towel over your head to trap in <a href=# rel=noopener>steam</a> for 5 minutes to allow your skin to soften.”</p><p>Just be sure to cut yourself off after five minutes; anything longer can cause&nbsp;TEWL (transepidermal water loss and dehydration).</p><h2>Pinch Up Instead of Digging Down</h2><p>However, if you must extract, Marino stresses doing it “with caution and care.” But first, “put down the knife” and “use clean fingers only.”</p><p>“Leave digging <a href=# rel=noopener>devices</a> to the professionals to avoid potential permanent scarring or pigmentation issues and injury,” she adds. Instead, “wrap your finger in tissue or cotton, gently pinch the skin together and press upward. Press only the direction you want the congestion to go. If you’re pressing down into the skin, you’re making things worse and potentially spreading bacteria under the skin.”</p><p>In general, you should be gentle and leave aggravated or super <a href=# rel=noopener>stubborn acne</a> alone. Most importantly, give your pores a break in-between; no need to steam or extract every other day.</p><h2>Don’t Forget to Cool Off</h2><p>Once you’ve extracted a blackhead or two, cleansing and treating the skin afterward is of the utmost importance. Immediately cleanse and <a href=# rel=noopener>tone the face</a>, ideally something with AHAs and BHAs to micro-exfoliate and balance the skin, like the Biologique Recherche Lotion P50W.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/biologique-recherche-lotion-p50w.jpg><h2 class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-title-lg data-transform data-truncate>Biologique Recherche Lotion P50W</h2><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$171</span></p><p>Marino also recommends incorporating <a href=# rel=noopener>cooling products</a> into your post-removal routine as well. One of her favorite go-to serums is the iS Clinical HydraCool Serum and if you can, she vouches for an ice roller to immediately reduce inflammation and pain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/is-clinical-hydra-cool-serum.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/213nAT-dB-L._SL500_.jpg><p>Should you want to take things a step further, treat yourself to a mask like Biologique Recherche’s <a href=# rel=nofollow>Vivant</a> too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/stackedskincare-ice-roller.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21oIe6mQuFL._SL500_.jpg><h2>Stay Balanced With Moisture Binders & Retinol</h2><p>Whether you’re into DIY extractions or not, the best way to prevent blackheads is with <a href=# rel=noopener>regular exfoliation</a>, daily cleansing and moisture, moisture, moisture.</p><p>“Support balance using humectants and moisture binders like hyaluronic acid,” suggests Marino. “Don’t overly dry. Limit benzoyl peroxide, as it can create a rebound effect of more production of sebum.”</p><p>A <a href=# rel=noopener>retinol</a> product like the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Better Skin AlphaRet</a> also helps with skin cell turnover minus the trauma and if you want to go for the big guns, do it with a weekly <a href=# rel=noopener>peel</a>. Pro-tip: it doesn’t have to be a liquid solution; something like the <a href=# rel=nofollow>AlphaRet Peel Pads</a> are just as effective.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
