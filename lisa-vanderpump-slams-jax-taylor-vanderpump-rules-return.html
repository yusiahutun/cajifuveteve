But if you're going to negate me publicly, why come have an event at my restaurant?"</p><p>In short, she didn't understand why he would slam her, while also capitalizing on her name by hosting something at her business.</p><p>When Jax showed up to SUR, he asked whether he could sit with Lisa and James; she was immediately cold. "If you have to," she said, before he added, "If you don't mind."</p><p>"I kinda do. I don't even really want you to be here, to be honest," she then told him. "The way you come here expecting everything to be so cool and cozy and here you are on a podcast saying, 'Lisa's a prop, she's not needed, she's superfluous.'"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:236f08dd-9fc5-467e-a8de-dc9c3218a393 data-container-ref=toofab:article:9cea9772-3b85-4d32-966d-2095897960c6 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/01/5by4/2024/04/03/013e93c49e0a4c2eafdaa341acee6966_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo / Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Brittany Cartwright Details 'Horrible Fight' with Jax Taylor That Was Her 'Breaking Point'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>While Jax admitted he didn't even know what the word "superfluous" meant, he did say something along those lines during an appearance on The Toast podcast in 2023. "I think she's a prop at this point," he said at the time. "I don’t mean that in a negative way, but let's be honest ... She's not bringing anything to the show anymore."</p><p>She then reminded Jax that she "could have hit back and said in the press, the only person that wasn't needed in the show was you," but didn't. Jax, however, was upset that LVP, in the three years since he and <a href=#><strong>Brittany Cartwright</strong></a> left the show, hadn't "checked in on me and my wife," something which left him feeling as though "you wrote me off."</p><p>"You're such a f--king hypocrite," said Lisa, before Jax reiterated how he felt she "wrote me off after 10 years," before apologizing if he ever "said something wrong in the heat of the moment."</p><p>While Lisa said she had no intention to bring up "all the s--t you talk about me," she felt she had to because he was out there "putting your name on a flyer about my business." Jax got her point and the two basically agreed to move on, giving her a hug and telling her he loved her.</p><p>Lisa, of course, got the last laugh -- telling him, "I kind of love you too, even though you're really f--king annoying."</p><p>Vanderpump Rules and Jax's spinoff, The Valley, both air Tuesdays on Bravo.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f343277e-f5b4-40b3-81a8-144aa0e1e4c3 data-container-ref=toofab:article:9cea9772-3b85-4d32-966d-2095897960c6 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7d/5by4/2024/03/19/7dd1e3e349164afeaaa21e47c82f3365_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jax Taylor Tears Into 'Disgrace' Tom Sandoval During Vanderpump Rules Return</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21ma2tfoba0rYyvmKeclae9trnPZqqlmZ2oequt12armrGcpL9uwsCnm56qoKq6sXnRrqOeq12nsrXB0adm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
