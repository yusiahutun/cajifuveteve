The luxury industry veteran set out to change that obsolete attitude at the storied Swiss maison.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Founded in 1833, Jaeger-LeCoultre is one of the most prestigious watchmakers, known for iconic pieces such as its signature Reverso, and for being the company behind some of the world’s most complex movements and one-of-a-kind creations such as Atmos clocks.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As the head of a house that has been around for 190 years, Rénier is well aware that the average luxury lover can be easily put off by the aura surrounding the watch world, which can come across as cliquey and not welcoming to newcomers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/02/69226d10-1236-4007-8e83-1187a50eeb8c_1077ee3c.jpg>“We want to be known for our history and timelessness but also for what we represent in terms of style and creativity,” Rénier says in an interview <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">at Watches and Wonders</span></a>, the yearly watch fair held in Geneva. “We don’t want to just talk to collectors and watch experts – we already know how to do that and we’ve been doing it for a long time. We want to welcome a wider audience. Sometimes watchmaking is seen as a world of experts and can be intimidating. I want the public to be curious about what we do.”<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">5 of the best luxury timepieces with perpetual calendar functions</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Rénier, however, doesn’t want to break with the past and to shun “the history and patrimony of Jaeger-LeCoultre”, which she says is what brought her to the house in the first place. On the contrary, she has been shining a spotlight on the legacy of craftsmanship and innovation through partnerships with artists and designers, immersive exhibitions, savoir faire workshops and by opening the doors of the manufacture in Switzerland to the public.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/02/0d722349-081f-4660-b48b-79ff254b02b0_5fbd8e20.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I found that there were a lot of things to tell with a louder voice and this is what I’ve been doing over the last five years,” says Rénier, who before moving to Switzerland spent a decade in Hong Kong.</p>Rénier says that <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Gen Z and millennials</span></a> are surprisingly well attuned to a luxury brand like Jaeger-LeCoultre. “The young generation, who lives through digital and speed and immediate information – tools like phones that are discarded after a few years – suddenly come to our world and it’s timeless,” she says. “Time slows down and they find these values that are reassuring in today’s world: respect for history and craftsmanship, and the fact that <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">a model like the Reverso</span></a> is extremely appealing and relevant.”<figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1eav71q e1haapfp2">We don’t want to just talk to collectors and watch experts … we want to welcome a wider audienceCatherine Rénier, CEO, Jaeger-LeCoultre</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Reverso, an elegant timepiece with its unmistakable rectangular case that can be turned over to protect the dial, was first created in 1931 for polo players so that they could stop the glass from breaking during games. “You buy something that’s recognisable and has a history and a strong message,” says Rénier. “Iconic watches from houses like Jaeger-LeCoultre resonate well with the younger generation. We see the Reverso on the wrist of young people for all of these reasons.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/02/a8847645-5c63-4262-8bfe-08978ad21a83_34b96136.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The timepiece was front and centre at Watches and Wonders, where the house unveiled new iterations of the original design.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“That’s how you remain relevant in your time: you respect the past and get inspiration and you bring what people expect, and for the Reverso it’s the simplicity and beauty of the original model,” says Rénier. “It’s about reinventing it and adding little details: you don’t change the case or the spirit but you bring this contemporary touch to stay relevant to your time.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">5 dazzling Swiss luxury watches with moon phase complications</span></p></a></h3>Rénier says that there’s nothing like the red carpet to bring to life the beauty and elegance of a watch. The brand’s ambassadors – actors Nicholas Hoult and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Anya Taylor-Joy</span></a> – are a perfect fit, she explains, adding that Hoult is a big fan of cars and visited the manufacture with his dad. He brought Taylor-Joy on board after starring with her in last year’s film The Menu. The connection with Taylor-Joy, however, goes deeper. Raised partly in Argentina, she comes from a family of polo players, which made the partnership even more seamless.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/02/bfcd55b0-4d38-4ca2-b6a3-b778410c89ef_a00c613c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s always about the meaning and the message, not just the image and them being beautiful, but the connection with our ambassadors and how they convey the message for the maison,” says Rénier. “It’s very important for our products to be worn. We don’t want to be seen as too removed from the real world so when you take a timepiece, even a complication, and put it on a wrist and the public sees it, it helps convey the message because it comes to life.”</p>Speaking of luminaries, Jaeger-LeCoultre boasts none other than <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">the late Queen Elizabeth</span></a> as one of its fans. She famously wore a diamond-set Calibre 101 bracelet watch from the maison at her coronation in 1963. Jaeger-LeCoultre is indeed one of the few watchmakers that started making <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">timepieces for women</span></a> from its early days, a rare practice even as late as fifty years ago.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/02/9fbbcfa3-7019-4695-82e6-51c531245307_a00c613c.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">6 most dazzling diamond-encrusted watches for ladies looking to shine</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As Rénier raves about this and other anecdotes, her passion is palpable. “I love the product – that’s my passion. I love how we express ourselves through the product and the history behind it,” she says. “I’m very much about craftsmanship and I love to protect what we’ve done and bring a new twist to what we do. I don’t want a rupture and to completely forget the past and start a new story but I want continuity and to bring this touch of sophistication and elegance that Jaeger-LeCoultre is about.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As for what she misses about her old stomping ground – the rarefied world of jewellery – it’s the faster pace. “The development of watchmaking is very long and I’m not very patient,” she says. “I speak about our products with such passion because we have to wait so long and when they finally come out I’m like, ‘Finally it’s here!’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZqWtqKq%2FunvAq6uim5yafHR%2BkHJobWlfrK61r8eeqmaZnpl6uLvNnZyrq11nfXN%2FjKOYnp%2BVp3qtscKorKWsopp6pLHOZpqarJiav6q6xGapnqaZmr9uw8eyZJqmqZZ6ta3YpaarZZqkxm6tzZ1kp6GTnbytrdI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
