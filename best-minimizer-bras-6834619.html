Beyond the daily struggle of finding clothes that fit properly, women with larger breasts often have to deal with chronic neck, shoulder, and back pain. And we would be remiss if we didn’t mention the discomfort that comes from shoulder straps digging into their skin.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The struggle is indeed real, but a good minimizer can do the heavy lifting (no pun intended) to compress your breasts and take precious inches off your bust line so that your clothes fit correctly. The best minimizers reduce fullness without flattening; they shape your breasts, smooth out any underarm bulge, and if you’re lucky, you might even find one with comfy straps that don’t dig into your shoulders.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When shopping for minimizers, Cami Raymond, Senior Design Director for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Ruby Ribbon</a>, suggests looking for ones that are made with stretchy fabric, wide straps, and a band that can provide most of the support. Also, look for minimizer bras that smooth your shape and try them on with problem wardrobe pieces so you can see the type of shape it gives. Our favorite is the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Le Mystère Side Profile Smoothing Minimizer Bra</a> because it checks off all those boxes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But read on for more of our top picks.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-le-mystre-side-profile-smoothing-minimizer-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Le Mystère Smoothing Minimizer Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Le Myst&amp;Atilde;&amp;uml;re Side Profile Smoothing Minimizer Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/78m7YVUb4PZ44QTmtQTKU5FynN0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/le-mystre-side-profile-smoothing-minimizer-bra-2eafb92e2ffa486583f50518cc302093.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bare Necessities</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Le Mystère’s Side Profile Smoothing Minimizer does everything a minimizer should do. Designed with molded underwire cups and an inner power micro liner for an ultra-smooth finish, the bra looks great even under t-shirts. The cups are soft, but there’s ample support for the girls and no unwanted padding. It also features side smoothing wings to further cover and smooth.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And while the floral jacquard lace looks pretty and delicate, make no mistake, the mesh liner is doing the heavy lifting to keep underarm bulges in check. It even features fully adjustable stretch straps and a leotard or ballet back, which adds even more support. Ultimately, if you’re looking for a minimizer with a natural look, this is it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>C - H<strong> </strong>|<strong> Colors: </strong>2<strong>&nbsp;</strong>|<strong> Materials: </strong>Polyamide, elastane<strong>, </strong>spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-value-bali-passion-for-comfort-minimizer-underwire-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Value</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bali Passion For Comfort Minimizer Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bali Passion for Comfort Minimizer Underwire Bra " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/EvI1P8GkBOQaoyGrywqnH_KE37w=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bali-passion-for-comfort-minimizer-underwire-bra-5077342ada7943ada416dadce85f2af9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Anyone who regularly shops for a minimizer can tell you that it’s pretty hard to find a good, supportive minimizing bra for under $50, but Bali does it in fine style with their Passion for Comfort Minimizer. It goes up to a G cup — and covers many in-between sizes, like DDDs and small bands with large cups — plus 26 different colors for anyone who likes to keep their options open.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While this bra offers smooth, full coverage with no counterproductive padding, wearers will find plenty of support courtesy of its hidden and encased underwires. Bali’s Passion for Comfort Minimizer Bra has elegant lace insets where the cups meet the straps, but it still looks smooth under t-shirts and knits, and reviewers often note a visible reduction in bust size.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>C - G<strong> </strong>|<strong> Colors: </strong>26 |<strong> Materials: </strong>Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-strapless-lilyette-strapless-minimizer-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Strapless</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lilyette Strapless Minimizer Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lilyette Strapless Minimizer Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/rSMEjSotbgGCRhISPktnZ9M94UI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lilyette-strapless-minimizer-bra-f3e3b069cad24ddb91ea6b32046dfd66.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Macy's</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">No lingerie closet is complete without a strapless bra for formal wear. And if you’re well endowed, a minimizer is crucial so as not to detract from your finery. Naturally, slippage is a concern for anyone who wears a minimizer—especially when it comes to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>strapless bras for large breasts</a>—but with a wide band, invisible boning, and silicone along the interior top and sides, Lilyette’s Strapless Minimizer elegantly handles any potential issues. With seamless molded cups and underwires for shaping, this strapless bra minimizes your bust line up to 1.5 inches, offers plenty of lift and support, and artfully smooths out your silhouette.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A quadruple back hook-and-eye closure and sweetheart neckline round out a nice list of features.

Reviewers have noted that this bra does its job to minimize their bust line up to 1 1/2 inches while still offering plenty of support. It beautifully shapes and smoothes your sides and back, and the straps are a good width and thickness, so there is less chance of them digging into the tops of your shoulders. “The Vanity Fair minimizing bra is perfect for everyday wear. It’s comfortable, lightweight, and will ensure your clothes look flawless when worn,” says Ghana Sarfo, brand ambassador for<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes"> Snatched Body</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>C - H<strong> </strong>|<strong> Colors: </strong>12<strong> </strong>|<strong> Materials: </strong>Nylon, spandex, polyester</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-montelle-pure-plus-full-coverage-t-shirt-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Montelle Pure Plus Full Coverage T-Shirt Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Montelle Pure Plus Full Coverage T-Shirt Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ZrhshMJG--vXmld_jm6Mkt-eI6g=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/montelle-pure-plus-full-coverage-t-shirt-bra-c9c628a3143e4122a776b5285c5414c7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Montelle</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to reviewers, this highly-rated plus-size minimizer is extremely flattering. Typically, padding is often counterproductive for minimizers, but the slight padding on Montelle’s Pure Plus Full Coverage T-Shirt Bra offers modest coverage without any unwanted bulk. Crafted with the brand’s ultra-soft microfiber and a lightweight four-way stretch foam cup, this T-shirt bra beautifully lifts and supports your bust without throwing your curves under the bus.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The side wings and underbust of the bra are lined with a power mesh for exceptional smoothing. It’s even embellished with smooth stretch floral lace (that adds even more support), but it’s virtually imperceptible under clothes and oh-so-pretty. And if the bra didn’t offer enough support already, it also features a ballet back, and the strap widths and hook-and-eye columns increase with size.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>B - H<strong>&nbsp;</strong>|<strong> Colors: </strong>10<strong>&nbsp;</strong>|<strong> Materials: </strong>Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-chantelle-c-magnifique-seamless-unlined-minimizer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Chantelle Seamless Unlined Minimizer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=800 data-sizes=750px alt="Chantelle C Magnifique Seamless Unlined Minimizer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5AXq7DVuzbxTOT6ymxTvBspC2xM=/fit-in/1500x800/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/chantelle-c-magnifique-seamless-unlined-minimizer-170d6879357347ea8e3ae3691c5f3646.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Chantelle</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With underwires, thick straps, and quality fabric, the C Magnifique Minimizer from Chantelle minimizes your bust line by one inch, all the while providing ample coverage and plenty of lift and support. The sides aren’t particularly wide (compared to other brands), but they beautifully smooth out underarm bulges.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The soft stretch cups are lightly lined and smooth, ultimately creating a rounded, natural shape while providing a seamless look under any outfit. Inner support panels in the full-coverage cups help center the breast tissue, further adding to the bra’s slimming and minimizing effect. A leotard back helps to take some weight off your shoulders for the ultimate in comfort, and a double-lined mesh band subtly smooths your back and sides.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>D - DDD<strong> </strong>|<strong> Colors: </strong>7 |<strong> Materials: </strong>polyamide, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-t-shirt-wacoal-womens-visual-effects-minimizer-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best T-Shirt</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Wacoal Visual Effects Minimizer Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1500 data-sizes=750px alt="Best Bras" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/PR7DXz5C680Ogi0eNvfWaZZyQCE=/fit-in/1500x1500/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/072922-wacoal-womens-plus-size-visual-effects-minimizer-bra-embed-32d8c3be754444adb6f1d0fbee3138a8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Wacoal’s Visual Effects Minimizer Bra promises to comfortably reduce your bustline by one inch — according to reviews, it does just that. This minimizer is designed with underwires and a double-layer molded cup for maximum support. And unlike other minimizers (which, let’s face it, can be kind of boring), the cups are made with a beautiful stretch lace that defies the odds — it’s not itchy, offers full coverage, and looks surprisingly smooth under your clothes.

The double-layered fabric cups look smooth under your clothes, and there’s no extra padding to add unwanted bulk. The minimizer bra also features plush adjustable straps, a ballet back for added comfort and support, and a J hook that turns the bra into a racer back in mere seconds.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One reviewer summed it up nicely and even offered a clever explanation for how Lively’s Minimizer Bra does what it does, “My life is complete!

But women who regularly shop for minimizers will probably tell you that it’s slightly more challenging to find a bra in this category. You’re looking for a bra that offers comfortable support and reduces your bustline without smooshing your assets and obliterating your curves — that can be a pretty tall order. Ultimately, when you’re shopping for minimizers, think about compression first, but pay attention to the overall construction and try to steer clear of padding.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“When looking for a minimizer bra, it’s important to look for a bra that fits your shape,” says Sarah Sullivan, Creative Director of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">LIVELY</a>. “A few things are in play when shopping for a minimizer bra. The shape of the wire should not only provide support for the weight of your breasts but also allow your breast tissue to spread. The fabric should provide a good amount of compression but not flatten your shape like a sports bra might. The shape of the cup should help spread the breast tissue to minimize the projection of the breast. And lastly, since there is a lot of weight to support, look for a strap that will provide comfort all day — one that is slightly padded or wider than a traditional strap.”&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Compression</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“You also want to consider how much compression you like as some extreme minimizer bras might distort the shape of your breasts, possibly giving you a look you don’t like,” says Sarfo. “A minimizer bra should lessen the size of your breast when worn, not fully distort the way they look.”&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Ballet or leotard backs&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Sullivan, ballet backs are a “great option when shopping for minimizers, and they should be on your checklist. “Ballet Backs provide good support, especially for larger breast sizes,” she says. “The shape of the back and the distance between the back straps allow the band to hug your body more closely, providing comfort and support.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Cami Raymond notes that “ballet backs really make a difference as the “U” shape enables the bra to lift your bust line by having the band under the bust stay secure. The “U” shape also helps elongate the torso, improves your posture, and even prevents [the bra] straps from falling down your shoulders.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Avoid padding&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“If you are looking to minimize, you should avoid bras with thick padding,” says Sullivan. “The goal is to minimize, so you don’t want the extra volume of a pad. [Fortunately] most minimizer bras are made with some sort of compression fabric [which are] slightly thicker than a typical unlined bra, so you will still get the modesty of a lightly padded bra without the added size.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What does a minimizer bra do?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“A minimizer bra purpose essentially makes your breasts smaller by flattening them to your chest more so than a regular bra,” says Sarfo. “For those who have larger breasts, it can be tough to find clothing that accommodates them.

A minimizer bra should feel tighter than a normal bra but not to the point where it feels painful, as this means it is the wrong size. The bra should be snug but not dig into your skin.”&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sharon Brandwein</a> is a freelance writer and SEO specialist.
