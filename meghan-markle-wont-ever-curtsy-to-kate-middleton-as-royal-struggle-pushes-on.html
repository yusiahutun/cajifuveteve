A royal expert says that Megan would never want to curtsy to her sister-in-law Kate Middleton.</strong> <strong>Hence, the Duchess of Sussex would not want to return to the UK.</strong></p><p>Ever since <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a>‘s marriage to Prince Harry, reports of tension between her and <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> have been rife. The Duke of Sussex confirmed the rumors himself in his 2023 memoir Spare. He detailed several instances when <a href=#>Meghan and Kate’s feud came to a boiling point</a>. From Charlotte’s flower girl dress to Meghan’s ‘baby brain’ comment, the two have not been the best of friends since the start. A royal expert who helped <a href=#>Princess Diana</a> write her 1992 book Diana: Her True Story, is now saying that the former Suits actress would never want to curtsy to her sister-in-law and future queen Kate.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-998742670-1024x738.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-markle-won-t-ever-curtsy-to-sister-in-law-kate-middleton>Meghan Markle won’t ever curtsy to sister-in-law Kate Middleton</h2><p>A royal expert recently expressed that Meghan, 42, would not want to return to the UK and face the need to curtsy to Kate. Speaking on Sky News’ Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips, expert Andrew Morton <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ruled out</a> the possibility of Meghan and Harry’s move to the UK.</p><p>Morton, who collaborated with the late Princess Diana for her 1992 book was asked if Meghan and Harry would ever return to the UK. “What, and have Meghan Markle curtseying to Kate Middleton? I don’t think so. I don’t see that as a runner. They’ve got their own lives in California” was his response.</p><p>If Meghan ever returns to the UK, she will be required to curtsy to Kate once she becomes the Queen. The relations between <a href=#>King Charles</a>‘ two daughters-in-law have been strained for years now. The Sussexes Oprah interview and <a href=#>Prince Harry</a>‘s Spare memoir further drew a wedge between them. The former royals’ above-mentioned moves also gravely damaged Harry’s relationship with his elder brother <a href=#>Prince William</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-1199057240.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-harry-won-t-be-meeting-king-charles-during-uk-visit>Harry won’t be meeting King Charles during UK visit</h2><p>Meghan is sitting tightly in Montecito, California, as Prince Harry goes on his globe-trotting adventures. The Duke will be in London on September 7 for the 2023 WellChild Awards. Ahead of his brief UK visit, reports that <a href=#>Harry and King Charles</a> were set to host “peace talks” during his time in the country surfaced.</p><p>The rumors gave hope to the royal fans who wanted to see Diana’s second son patch things up with his father. However, now a palace insider has told the Daily Mail, that the King has “no time in the diary” to see his ‘Spare’ son.</p><p>Moreover, there are no reports of <a href=#>Harry and William ending their feud</a> and planning a meeting to patch things up.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlxX2WEcLnEoJ%2Bapl2irrO3y55ksKeeqXqmwsSrZJytoqnAunnTqGSkmaSaeq61w52jnqyfo3qiv4yrprKZnGLAtb7UoJ6lnV2lwrS0xKxkqKZf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
