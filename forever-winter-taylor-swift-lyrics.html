In an interview <a href=# rel=noopener>Rolling Stone</a> in 2021, Swift called Red her only “true” heartbreak album, and it’s believed that “heartbreak” was caused by Jake Gyllenhaal, whom she dated from October 2010 to January 2011.&nbsp;“I look back on this [Red] as my true breakup album, every other album has flickers of different things. But this was an album that I wrote specifically about pure, absolute, to the core, heartbreak,” Swift said at the time.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">New York magazine</a> in 2013, Swift revealed how the subject of Red reacted to the album. (She claimed that the reaction was better than the “crazy emails” she received from another ex-boyfriend, who is believed to be John Mayer.) “He was like, ‘I just listened to the album, and that was a really bittersweet experience for me. It was like going through a photo album.’ That was nice,” Swift said at the time. “Nicer than, like, the ranting, crazy e-mails I got from this one dude.”</p><p>While most of Red is about Gyllenhaal, fans believe that “Forever Winter” isn’t about any of Swift’s ex-boyfriends and instead is about her brother, Austin Swift, and his struggle with mental health. “100% believe this being about her brother,” one user wrote on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>. Another added, “I could see it being about a family member or friend.”</p><p>One clue that “Forever Winter” could be about Swift’s brother is the lyric, “<span class=s1>Too young to know it gets better,” which confirms that the subject of the song is younger than Swift. (Gyllenhaal was nine years older than Swift.) Austin, who is Swift’s younger brother, is two years younger than her.&nbsp;</span></p><p>In “Forever Winter,” which touches on themes of mental health and suicide, Swift sings about how she worries about the subject of the song and wants to “disarm” the “bomb” in their head.&nbsp; “<span class=s2>If I was standing there in your apartment /&nbsp; </span><span class=s1>I’d take that bomb in your head and disarm it / </span><span class=s1>I’d say I love you even at your darkest and / </span><span class=s1>Please don’t go,” she sings.</span></p><p class=p1>In the song, Swift also sings about how her life will be “forever winter” if the subject of the track leaves. “<span class=s2>I’ll be summer sun for you forever /&nbsp;</span><span class=s1>Forever winter if you go,” she sings. In a 2009 interview with The Philadelphia Inquirer, Swift explained that one of her favorite memories with her brother was when they would spent summers at Stone Harbor in New Jersey.&nbsp;</span>“I spent my summers at the Jersey Shore from the time I was 2 until we sold the house in Stone Harbor when I was 14,” Swift told The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2009. “It was a pretty magical place to grow up.”</p><p>Read the lyrics to Taylor Swift’s “Forever Winter”, via <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Genius</a>, below. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Red (Taylor’s Version)</a> is available on <a
