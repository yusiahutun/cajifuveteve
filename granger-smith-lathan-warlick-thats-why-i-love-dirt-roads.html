Gone is the acoustic and steel guitars and steady drum patter that drove an organic, open-road country vibe. This remake favors piano chords, heavy reverb and dramatic, studio-generated beats.&nbsp;The collaboration between two very different artists is intended to be as much of a social statement as it seems.&nbsp;A note from Smith’s record label Wheelhouse Records shares that the love and hate that has been on display over the last week led to a decision to promote this version as a radio single right now, instead of just dropping it as a remix for fans to find and programmers to play if they chose.</p><p>Warlick's participation begins during the second verse, where he adds new lyrics that reflect his experiences:</p><p class=p1>"Yeah, you never know what to expect or what’s coming next when riding them dirt roads / The gravel and dust, might throw you off if I’m ready or not only God knows / It’s hard trynna hold it together when I lost a couple of people along the ride / Wish I could roll back the hands on a clock just to tell ‘em ‘I love you’ just one more time / I wasn’t prepared for the pain that came, it had me tore up on the inside / But I can hear you on the side of me whispering softly telling me not to cry / Just when I thought I was hopeless you kept reminding me how you’ll never leave / And all of them people we lost had a place up in heaven so make sure I get a seat / We go through some ups and downs and might even have a few curves we don’t see / I end up at home every time, cause God got his hand on my life and he guiding me, yeah."</p><p class=p1>On his <a href=#>website</a>, Warlick recounts growing up on a side of Jackson, Tenn., known for gangs and violence and tells a story of being held up at gunpoint in 2011. He prayed for God to intervene, but the trigger was pulled anyway. Thankfully,&nbsp;there was no bullet in the chamber, so all he heard was a click.</p><p class=p1>Smith explains how he and Warlick came together on Instagram, saying that his wife shared how the "Tellem That I'm Coming" singer had been adding new lyrics to popular songs. A DM or two later and the pair agreed on what Smith labels "an unlikely collaboration."</p><p class=p1>"This dude, through his own path, has pulled the layers back on life and sees things in a new way ... with truth, integrity and God first," Smith writes. "I only hope that one day I can see as clearly as he does."</p><p>The timing of the release corresponds to the many conversations about race and racial inequality being had nationwide since George Floyd's death in May. Nationwide protests have led to a deeper exploration of the topic, with the music industry even coming together to hit pause last Tuesday (June 2). The 40-year-old Smith had&nbsp;been quiet on the subject on social media until Monday's release.</p><p><strong>These Are the Top 10 Country Songs of 2020:&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmoKqRo7SmvoyspKKsmGK5osDHmqVmr5GnuaqvymaroZmkqHq4tNhmoGakn6uybrDIq6tmqp%2BWsbR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
