She recalled the incident saying, “It wasn’t to the point of going to the hospital, but I remember getting up off the floor in the morning – and that was the last time I ever touched a drug again.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-pink-s-troubled-childhood-that-led-to-the-drug-addiction>Pink’s troubled childhood that led to the drug addiction</h2><p>Pink’s turn to the wild side of life happened as she dealt with huge personal challenges. Her parents divorced at an early age resulting in her being shuttled between homes quite frequently.</p><p>Speaking of the time, she revealed: “Nobody asked your age on club doors and everyone had fake IDs anyway,” adding, “I wasn’t interested in school, sports, hobbies, or any of the other supposedly healthy things kids should be into. I just wanted to get high. I was running wild and heading for a fall.”</p><p>After the inevitable had happened, it was only a journey of going up and onwards as she gushed: “I was the pariah of my school and the shameful specimen of my disjointed family. I was lucky to survive and, since then, I never touched drugs.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-1500442551-1024x682.jpg><p><strong>If you’ve been affected by this story you can contact American Addiction Centers on (877) 686-7688 or Talk To Frank on 0300 123 6600 in the UK.</strong></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlxX2WFcLzIp6KsZZKnwrS0jLCgraBdmbKiwMdmrpqrXZZ6uK3KnmSuqF2Yrq24jJqdrZ2iYq5usMCnnp6qn6rAbrrIoJ%2BtZZ%2BqwXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
