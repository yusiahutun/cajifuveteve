"We didn't do it on purpose this way," Young confessed to ABC News Radio, adding,&nbsp;"but I knew once the song was written that I was gonna get credit for this song in two different stages." He continued, "I knew that I was gonna immediately get credit from my wife for a love song, and then years down the road, when my daughter was old enough to understand, I'd get credit for that one, too."</p><p>And that he did! According to Young, his wife was reduced to tears upon hearing the song for the first time. "I got a text back with all the emojis of her bawling her eyes out," Brett dished. "You know, you never really wanna make a woman cry, but in a situation like that, I think it's okay."</p><p>In May 2020, he told <a href=#>iHeartRadio</a> of the song,&nbsp;"I was excited to write this from way before we found out we were pregnant." He continued, "I've always kind of jokingly called my wife 'Lady,' and so when we found out that we were having a little girl, she became 'little lady.'"</p><p>As of this writing, there's still no word on whether or not Young plans to commemorate the upcoming birth of his second child with yet another single. He is adamant, however, that he's not in the business of churning out lullabies. "Unfortunately, the first one I wrote I like so much that I haven't written any more because I can't have an album full," he joked (via Taste of Country).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG5lZ31ye9OhnGaqlZa5brnEmqWippdir6a0yKebZqSRmcZurthmmaudpKl6urvUp55o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
