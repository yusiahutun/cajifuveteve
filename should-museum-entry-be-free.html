To begin with, free entry could make it hard to keep museums open. Running a museum costs a fortune, including the cost of security, preservation and salaries."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Running a museum costs a fortune, including the cost of security, preservation and salaries.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Free entry also could limit the development of museums. Without the revenue from entry fees, museums would not have enough money to collect and preserve cultural objects and hold extra exhibitions of rare pieces.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">What's more, I doubt if free admission would boost the number of visitors.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The main reason why people do not visit museums is their lack of interest. They prefer to go shopping or watch movies than spend a day with an old gramophone or bridal sedan chair. People are just not that interested in history and culture. Even if admission was free, it might not make a big difference in attendance numbers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Also, entry fees are already very low, around HK$10. Most people can afford it, but many choose not to go.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Museums should attract more visitors through promotion and education. Doing away with entry fees would only affect their development.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jessica Leung, 16, Our Lady of the Rosary College</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Museums are not very popular in Hong Kong. But I think they are of great value.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Admission to most Hong Kong museums is not free except for Wednesdays. I think admission should be free all the time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">First, I would like to talk about the educational value of museums. Museums are not just places to see exhibitions but also to learn about many things, including culture and history. Many schools bring their students to museums to teach them things. The students can gain a better understanding of different topics and their hometown. They can also enhance their knowledge. This is priceless.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Charging admission would restrict access to museums.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some poor families don't have extra money to spend on this activity. Children from these families have few chances to go to a museum. This is unfair and a loss to society.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The International Council of Museums says museums should be 'permanent institutions in the service of society and of its development, open to the public, which acquire, conserve, research, communicate and exhibit the tangible and intangible heritage of humanity and its environment, for the purposes of education, study and enjoyment'.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This statement shows that museums are not run for the purpose for making a profit. They are places where we can get cultural and historic information, and they should be free and non-profit making.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In conclusion, museum entry should be free so that everyone can visit and learn from these cultural assets.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdnaIZ2gpFoqqGnpaGxbrnUrJyupV2au7W%2B2GaZnmWWp7Km</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
