Forster’s A Room With A View involves whether it would be better to rent to a family rising up from humble beginnings or a family of noble background that has fallen on difficult times.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As economic, social and legal environments change, different traits will present greater fitness. The “innerworldly asceticism” of Max Weber’s Protestant ethic, which is often associated with successful entrepreneurs in the Global North, has found its counterpart in a Confucian ethic and a Catholic ethic that don’t retreat from the world but focus on change, progress and overcoming.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With that in mind, one might ask whether what is colloquially known as “old money” – the business families of Japan, North America and Europe that rose during the 1900s – has anything to learn from the “new rich” of the developing world.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In my experience of working with family businesses from both the Global North and the Global South, I would summarise the differences as relating to blood, government and frontiers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One of the starkest differentiating factors is openness to legacy-building along bloodlines. Old money families, however eager to send offspring to certain educational institutions, are not keen to bestow unearned riches upon their children.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The new rich of the Global South tend not to have such qualms. Privileges are to be passed down without reticence in the same vein as the royals of 1700s and 1800s Europe. While that can be problematic, it also points to opportunities old money is missing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Who better to run the family business than someone trained from early childhood for the job by the most competent person there is for that role, namely the CEO, who passes on his or her informal knowledge as well as personal connections? And if the best person for the job happens to be part of the family, why hold it against them?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Second, government. For perhaps the same reasons that nepotism is looked down upon in the Global North, so are government connections. School ties, university friendships and family linkages are important but not flaunted to meet standards of propriety.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the Global South, not only are government contracts openly sought but government linkages, political connections and other advantages are sought as simply “business”. Old money might wish to take a leaf out of new money’s book and fight without the white gloves. This is not an invitation to corruption or the like, but a plea for treating all business opportunities seriously.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Third, frontiers. New money tends to aggressively seek new markets. Businesses in the Global South are simply used to dealing with the issues faced in frontier markets. It is understood that demand will be met one way or another – and one’s personal feelings about it will not make a difference.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hong Kong, being a hub for both old and new money, can be the place where brainstorming on how old money can reinvent its approach takes place.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Radu Magdin, former adviser to the prime ministers of Romania and Moldova</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Next revolution to shape world may take place in Asia</h3>The <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">op-ed</span></a>, “From batik to silicon chips, Asia’s craftsmanship is its tech superpower” (April 19), discussed how Asian craftsmanship supports semiconductor design and manufacture, and noted that “the poor do not stay poor forever”. I feel that in addition to the cyclical nature of opportunity, the time cycle of innovation is now far quicker when it comes to technology, as opposed to heavy industry in the past.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was the industrial revolution in the 18th and early 19th centuries which powered Western imperialism by providing economic and military might. Ultimately, the East caught up. China, which became the world’s factory, is the best example. It has exported its way out of poverty to become the world’s second-largest economy. But it took China almost 200 years to do so.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After the industrial revolution, the next big revolution to shape the world order is in semiconductors and artificial intelligence. If China and other Asian countries succeed, then this revolution is likely to take place much faster, possibly in only a couple of decades. The possibility of China dominating semiconductors and AI is what causes the reigning superpower extreme anxiety, leading to the current geopolitical tensions, trade restrictions and even conflicts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The tide may even have already turned in mobile technology, 6G and electric vehicles, and this is reflected in the declining market capitalisation of major companies like Apple and Tesla.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sutinder Bindra, Discovery Bay</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Look to Book of Changes for insight into EV market</h3>I am writing to respond to <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">the letter</span></a>, “Romance of the Three Kingdoms in China’s EV market?” (April 22), which likened Tesla founder Elon Musk to northern Chinese warlord Cao Cao, who lost in the battle of the Red Cliff.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The founders of BYD and Xiaomi seem to be living by the first hexagram, Qian, in the Book of Changes. Initially, like the first unbroken line of the Qian hexagram that represents a hidden dragon, they both hid their ambition to be industry leaders and focused on making innovative and groundbreaking electric car models, pouring time, energy and resources in that direction. Gradually, they will rise and defeat their foreign competitor, doing their bit to achieve the Chinese dream.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fung Zhan Hong, Ho Man Tin</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kvLG1zaKmp2ecmsG1sdGsZpqqpJ6wrbGObGlvaGRpf3DDx5qrZqecmXquu82esGabkaN6rbHAq6VmppWseq67zZ6wZpmemXqpu9Zmn6iml2K4sLrGZpqapl2dsq28</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
