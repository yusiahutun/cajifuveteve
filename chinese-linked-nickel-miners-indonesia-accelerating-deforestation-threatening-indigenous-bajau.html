EV manufacturers should also audit their full supply chains “all the way back to the mines where the nickel in their EV batteries originates”, the group said.</p>Environmental damage and labour rights violations have been widely documented in nickel mines and refineries across Indonesia. In January, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">a report</span></a> by California-based Climate Rights International also alleged China-backed nickel plants had caused “significant” environmental destruction and were an existential threat to the indigenous peoples on the island of Halmahera in Maluku province.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The first thing to remember is, while China may not be an environment leader, it also doesn’t want to be an environmental laggard. We just have to look at China as a complicated partner, but one that is interested in what the international community thinks,” Hurowitz said during the webinar.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Robert Blake, former US Ambassador to Indonesia and current senior director at trade consultant McLarty Associates, said the Indonesia government “should not be shy about enforcing stronger environmental and labour standards on Chinese projects”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“China is gradually improving its environmental policies. It’s come under a lot of criticism for supporting fossil fuel development in the Belt and Road Initiative. You’re seeing more support now for renewable energy projects,” Blake said during the webinar.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Indonesia dreams of being a global EV player.

The Chinese are not going to go away. They need these projects for their own industries.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The green EV supply chain would also benefit Indonesia as more investors, particularly from the US and Europe, would look to tap into investing in the country, Blake said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Toxic impact</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Mighty Earth report documents how illegal deforestation was done to make way for nickel concessions that took place on the small island of Kabaena, off the southern tip of southeast Sulawesi.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It found that at least 17 hectares of areas zoned as Protection Forests, which were established to maintain biodiversity and ecosystems on the island, had been illegally deforested and at least 841 hectares of Production Forest, in which forestry uses are allowed, were lost to miners that did not have permits to clear the land.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In six villages on the island, which is home to the Bajau people, researchers found that “brown cloudy water in the ocean near the villages” forced the tribe to “go much further offshore to reach fishing grounds” and they had to buy more fuel, putting them further in debt.</p>The Bajaus, known for their ability to stay underwater for up to 10 minutes on a single breath through <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">the development of larger spleens and greater lung capacity</span></a>, now also find it hard to teach their children how to swim from an early age because of the contaminated water. Three Bajau children drowned in Baliara village in the last decade, the report said.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/18/dcac8ce2-92ba-4501-a672-2569421bf64a_4d6c5aff.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Last month, a flood occurred in the village after only half an hour of rainfall, which residents attributed to the soil degradation caused by the two nickel mines. Researchers found villagers in Puununu and Baliara suffered from “itchiness, festering and blistering” skin due to muddy water around the island.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The unchecked deforestation in Indonesia has tragically cost young lives and further threatens the health and well-being of the Bajau people. Our investigation also suggests the clearing may defy the law, imperilling not just people but wildlife that depend on standing forests,” Hurowitz said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">No permits</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Among the top 10 nickel mines responsible for deforestation named in the report are Vale Indonesia, whose controlling shareholder is state-owned mining holding company Mind ID; state-owned miner Aneka Tambang; and Bintang Delapan Mineral, which is affiliated with Tsingshan, Chinese stainless steel giant and EV battery materials producer.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The report alleges that large percentages of land area within the three miners’ nickel concessions were classified as “high carbon stock forest,” or intact forest; 85 per cent of the more than 2,700 hectares of forest that Bintang Delapan Mineral cut were supposedly intact forest, for example.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The group argues in the report that BMW, Mercedes-Benz and VW should remove Bintang Delapan Mineral from their supply chains, as “nearly the entire area of the Bintang Delapan Mineral concession falls within [the International Union for Conservation of Nature]-designated Key Biodiversity Area”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The EU Battery Regulation requires economic operators to consider taking steps to mitigate biodiversity loss in their supply chains, and to also consider removing from their supply chains companies that do not undertake such mitigating actions,” the report said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/18/458a675f-6507-41b3-8fa1-33b50fe04824_31ce9a5f.jpg>Atina Rizqiana, a social anthropologist at Jakarta-based think tank the Center of Economic and Law Studies, said it was unlikely that Indonesia would see more environmentally friendly policies under Prabowo. The former general said on the campaign trail that he would continue President Joko Widodo’s <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">downstreaming policy</span></a>, which bans the export of raw critical minerals such as nickel and bauxite.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Unfortunately, several policies advocated by his campaign fail to reflect any intention to lead Indonesia in an order that [promotes] democracy and environmentally friendly policies. The downstreaming [policy] has been proven to have a negative impact on the quality of life and economies of the surrounding communities,” Atina said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZLWmrcutn2adnqu2s7vNppynrF%2BWv7W1wqWcaGtiaoZ1g5VomqGhnprApnnLoqWknZRiu6qvyp6jZqWZo7Kzv4yipZ2nnprAqq2MmpqcnZyav6LAyKeeZpyVm7yzsdKtmK2hn6N6tbTRnpitnZ6eu6h5yKebop%2BVo7y2v4ybmKOZpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
