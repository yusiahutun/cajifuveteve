Grab your melted butter and leftover goodness and get ready to learn four different methods to reheat biscuits.&nbsp;</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to Reheat Biscuits in the Microwave</h2><p>You can use the microwave <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">method to reheat</a> just about any type of biscuit, especially when you’re short on time. Plus, the microwave is handy if you have some drive-thru leftovers and want to reheat KFC biscuits. The trick to keeping your biscuits from drying out in the microwave is to wrap them in a damp paper towel.&nbsp;</p><li>Wrap the biscuits in a damp paper towel.</li><li>Place the biscuits on a microwave safe container or plate.</li><li>Microwave the biscuits on medium to high for 20 to 30 seconds.&nbsp;</li><li>Check to see if they’re warm enough. If not, <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">reheat </a>the biscuits for an additional 10 to 15 seconds.</li><li>Serve and enjoy!</li><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to Reheat Biscuits in the Oven</h2><p>There’s a reason why most (if not all) kitchen designs include an oven: It’s the absolute <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">best way to reheat</a> most food. Sure, the trusty microwave and toaster oven can step in occasionally, but nothing beats the thorough heat of an oven.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Lazarus Lynch, host of Food Network’s <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">Comfort Nation</a> and<a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer"> Chopped U</a>, the oven is hands-down the best method to reheat biscuits. So, whether you want to reheat frozen biscuits or you’re looking for the best way to reheat Pillsbury biscuits, the oven is the way to go. Oh, and don’t let us forget to tell you that this is the best method to reheat Red Lobster biscuits. Here, Lynch shares his simple steps to reheat biscuits in the oven.&nbsp;</p><li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li><li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and arrange the biscuits on top.</li><li>Bake the biscuits until warmed. This typically takes about five to seven minutes.&nbsp;</li><li>Top the biscuits with butter.</li><li>Serve and enjoy!</li><p>Note that the time to <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">reheat</a> will vary based on your biscuit. If the biscuits are right out of the refrigerator, five to seven minutes will work. But if you want to reheat frozen biscuits, you might need to double the time in the oven. &nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to Reheat Biscuits in the Toaster Oven</h2><p>If you only need to <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">reheat</a> a few biscuits, but you want them to taste oven-fresh, then the toaster oven is the way to go. Similar to your oven, the toaster oven heats the biscuits all the way through, which gives them a fresh taste. Here are the five steps to follow if you want to reheat biscuits in the toaster oven.&nbsp;</p><li>Preheat the toaster oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li><li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and arrange the biscuits on top.</li><li>Bake the biscuits until warmed. This typically takes about five to seven minutes.&nbsp;</li><li>Top the biscuits with butter.</li><li>Serve and enjoy!</li><p>Note that the time to <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">reheat</a> will vary based on your biscuit. If the biscuits are right out of the refrigerator, five to seven minutes will work. But if you want to reheat frozen biscuits, you might need to double the time in the toaster oven. &nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to Reheat Biscuits in a Pan&nbsp;</h2><p>The stovetop is another tool in your kitchen you can use to <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">reheat</a> biscuits. Your first step is to determine the size of pan you want to use. If you only have one or two biscuits, you can get away with a medium-sized pan. But if you want to<a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer"> reheat</a> enough for the entire family, make sure the pan is on the larger side. Follow these simple steps, and you will be sinking your teeth into a butter biscuit in no time.</p><li>Choose the proper pan size for the number of biscuits you want to reheat.</li><li>Turn your stove on medium heat.</li><li>Place the pan on the stove (you want to heat up the temperature of the pan).&nbsp;</li><li>Wrap the biscuits in aluminum foil and place them in the pan. The foil prevents them from burning. If you want added moisture, you can brush melted butter or olive oil on the biscuits before wrapping them in foil.&nbsp;</li><li>Turn the heat to low and cover the pan if you have a lid (this helps retain moisture).</li><li>Heat for one to two minutes. Flip the biscuits around the 30-second mark to heat the other side. The biscuits are ready when they’re warm all the way through.&nbsp;</li><li>Serve and enjoy!</li><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to Reheat Frozen Biscuits</h2><p>The beauty of biscuits is the fact that you can fix, freeze, and forget about them. But before you toss and go, make sure you store them correctly. If you’re freezing before you bake them, place the biscuits in a sheet pan close together (but not touching) and place them in the freezer. This works best if you plan on baking the biscuits within the next few weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to store the biscuits for more than a month once frozen, take them out of the sheet pan and put them in a freezer-tight Ziplock bag. When freezing fresh out-of-the-oven biscuits, Lynch says to let them cool completely, then wrap each individual biscuit tightly in plastic wrap.&nbsp;</p><p>This method also works great for leftover biscuits. So, the next time you hit the town for a meal out, make sure to bring extras home. Restaurant biscuits make a perfect snack, but make sure to freeze them when you get home (if you don’t plan on eating them right away). Give this a try if you want to freeze and reheat Cheddar Bay biscuits or reheat <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Popeyes biscuits</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>And the best part? When you’re ready to reheat frozen biscuits, all you have to do is take them out of the freezer and bake! Here are the steps Lynch follows to reheat frozen biscuits.&nbsp;</p><li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li><li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and arrange the biscuits on top.</li><li>Bake the biscuits until they’re hot. This typically takes about 12-15 minutes.&nbsp;</li><li>Top the biscuits with butter.</li><li>Serve and enjoy!</li><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Meal Ideas to Serve With Biscuits</h2><p>Biscuits taste delicious no matter what you serve them with or the time of day you serve them.
