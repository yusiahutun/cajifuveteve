The supermarket has launched the OMV! Turkey & Trimmings for One: a serving of vegan turkey and sides for just £3.50 this year.</p><p>Complete with a cranberry and orange stuffing, vegan sage and onion stuffing balls and ‘no pigs’ in blankets, the OMV! Turkey & Trimmings for One is part of Asda's first-ever OMV! festive range, with new research revealing that 75% of vegans have felt the need to bring their own main dish to Christmas.</p><p>Available in-store and online from the December 14, other products from the range include the OMV! No Turkey Joint with Umami Gravy, OMV! Oyster & Porcini Mushroom Wellington and OMV! Mushrooms Pigs in Smoky Aubergine Bacon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31649411.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/2_MAIN_roses.jpg><p>In the purpose of research, I decided to try out the range first-hand to see how I would cope with a totally vegan Christmas dinner.</p><p>Now I don't have much experience with vegan products, however I do love Quorn nuggets, so I thought I may be okay with the turkey if it tasted anything like that.</p><p>The <a href=# rel=nofollow>no-meat turkey</a> certainly looks impressive and even comes with its own 'skin'. What's better, it only took 40-45 minutes in the oven to cook. However, I'm sorry to say I don't think it compares with the real thing to me.</p><p>The taste was actually okay at first, although I couldn't handle much of it and obviously the texture isn't exactly the same as the real thing. It is perfect for someone who wants a straight turkey alternative though and has a taste for vegan 'meat'.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>Next was the<a href=# rel=nofollow> 'no pigs in blankets</a>', which consist of mushroom 'sausages' wrapped in aubergine rashers. Now the real pigs in blankets are one of my favourite things on a Christmas dinner, so again, I can't say they compared being made of mushroom and aubergine. But they are a very fun idea and a great way to mix it up with your Christmas veg.</p><p>As part of my taste test, I also tried out the <a href=# rel=nofollow>OMV! Strawberry Trifle</a> which was much more up my street. This is an alternative to a dairy based trifle which features tangy strawberry compote egg-free sponge and dairy-free custard, finished with a lentil and coconut cream.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31681411.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/4_I-tried-vegan-Christmas-turkey-to-see-how-it-compared-to-the-real-thing.jpg><p><b><i>Want all the biggest Lifestyle news straight to your inbox? <a rel=follow href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section>Sign up for our free Daily Star Hot Topics newsletter</a></i></b></p><p>I can safely say I really enjoyed this dish, which was really creamy and tasty. It doesn't really have as much sponge and jam as a typical trifle, but the coconut cream and dairy-free custard are loaded on and it went together very nicely.</p><p>All in all, I feel like I'll definitely be sticking with my turkey and gammon for my Christmas dinner, however I don't mind the odd vegan dessert now and again if it's being offered. When it comes to vegan savoury offerings, I think Quorn nuggets is my limit, sadly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKqVlrluuMifnGihXam%2FqrHDZpisnJGoerexxpqlZpuYp7a0wMyaqmZrYWuFcnyTbA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
