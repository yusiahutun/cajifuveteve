"Afterward, the LYMA Laser is used to improve skin elasticity, reduce pigmentation, brighten and push skincare products deeper into the skin. Each facial is completely customised and unique to their skin concerns and will then offer additional skin therapies, including ultrasound, oxygen infusion and intensive face masks. Every facial finishes with powerful rejuvenating LED therapy with negative ions. It's a truly unique skin experience and addresses all of the individual's needs."&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>How do you prepare for the Met Gala in comparison to other events?</strong></h3><p id=eO1cuxU-lCd6 data-wc=74>"It depends how much time I have with a client ahead of the Met Gala. I like to work with clients four to six weeks in advance," Joanna says. "If I can’t see them in person, I will help from afar and recommend they use their LYMA Lasers 20 minutes daily. The days leading up to the Met, I focus on soothing, hydrating, evening complexion, sculpting the face, and reducing any inflammation or redness."</p><h3><strong>How do you deal with blemishes on the day?</strong></h3><p id=eIDqKHAchPye data-wc=49>"I try to avoid anything too invasive, for mild flare ups and blemishes, the LYMA laser is a great treatment. For any pimples, it’s a case-by-case scenario, but sometimes an extraction is necessary. In these instances, I focus on the healing process afterward to reduce any redness or inflammation."</p><h3><strong>Why is it important to get a facial before a big event?</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p id=emETUHvYOj2e data-wc=60>"Just like nourishing your body with the right nutrients to feel your best, you also need to nourish your skin for optimal appearance," Joanna advises. "While there are some amazing products and devices you can use at home for maintenance, I always recommend working with a professional in the field to treat your skin properly, especially before a big event."&nbsp;</p><p id=e5jUGkozh53t data-wc=21><strong>Like this story?<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to our Hello!
