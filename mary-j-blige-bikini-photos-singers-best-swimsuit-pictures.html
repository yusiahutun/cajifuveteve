I was already red. I was already doing those colors. I wasn’t searching for an image. I was my own image,” she told</span> <a href=#><i><span>Elle</span></i></a> <span>in January 2022.</span></p><p><span>The “Just Fine” singer also ventured into the world of acting, appearing in films like </span><i><span>Rock of Ages</span></i><span>,</span><i><span> Mudbound</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Respect</span></i><span>. Mary started her own wine business called Sun Goddess Wines, a jewelry collection called Sister Love and became the face of Gold Bond’s #ChampionYourSkin campaign in 2021 after finding a passion for skincare later in life.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“When I was younger, I wasn’t doing any of that,” she told </span><a href=#><span>PopSugar</span></a><span> in February 2021 about her introduction to skincare. “I was using lotion and whatever from what I can remember, but I wasn’t thinking about any facials, I wasn’t thinking about any body scrubs. You just grow into that.”</span></p><p><span>Though she is constantly jet-setting all over the world to perform or work on her next biggest hit, the New York native makes sure to leave room in her schedule to focus on self-care.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“My self-care routine, it always starts from the inside,” she told </span><i><span>Self </span></i><span>in October 2019. “I have to build myself up inside, spiritually. So, I start in the morning with prayer. Firstfruits of my day go to God, go to prayer. Get myself dressed, and then I go to the gym.”</span></p><p><span>Mary also shared some details about her workout routine and all the different ways she likes to stay active.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I have a trainer, I train four times a week,” she explained. “It’s full body. Sometimes I’ll tell them, ‘OK well let’s concentrate on the legs’, ‘well let’s concentrate on the arms,’ or ‘let’s go hard on the abs.’ So, it’s whatever I choose, whatever body parts I want it to be. And then I do cardio at the end of the week, like Friday, Saturday cardio.”</span></p><p><b>Keep scrolling to see Mary’s beautiful bikini photos.&nbsp;</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46mmKuxXZ96o7jIoJxmmpmgtq%2B1jKmfqKyfqHq0tc2gnKurXZeytMCMrK6ipaOqtrV5z6Kara2imsBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
