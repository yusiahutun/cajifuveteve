She was born and raised by Dempsey Narkle and Sanna Vuorinen-Akkanen in rural Western Australia and is of Aboriginal and Finnish descent.</p><p>Tuuli’s initial exposure to performing arts began with the practice of ethnic dance and gradually expanded to include acting and singing. Tuuli was admitted into the acting program at John Curtin College of the Arts as an adolescent and then went on to Charlesworth Ballet Institute to continue honing her classical ballet, contemporary, and character dance techniques.</p><p>Ruby was her first significant acting part in the Leah Purcell-directed and -produced Jane Harrison film, Stolen. Tuuli was inspired by this experience to apply to the NIDA (National Institute of Dramatic Arts) bachelor of fine arts program, from which she graduated in 2018.</p><p>Tuuli was cast in Winyanboga Yurringa at Belvoir St. Theatre after receiving her degree, and she then joined the cast of Black is the New White at Sydney Theatre Company. She played Belle in All My Friends Are Racist and Mary in Mystery Road: Origin in 2021. She played Miss Lacey in the television miniseries Bad Behaviour in 2022.</p><p>June 2023 finds the cast for the upcoming Australian series NCIS: Sydney. They include Tuuli Narkle.

The currently in-production streaming series will undoubtedly benefit from the actress’ skills. Just a few months ago, in May 2023, Tuuli and Sean Sagar were spotted heading to North Bondi with their crew to film sequences for the first NCIS international franchise.</p><p>Naturally, Tuuli has been quite enthusiastic about her career’s NCIS adventure. Her “dream role” with her “dream team” has been teased and promoted for the series on her social media pages for some time.</p><p>The “brilliant and eclectic” team of U.S. NCIS Agents and Australian Federal Police is claimed to be followed in the series as they are integrated into a multinational task force to prevent naval crimes in the most disputed area of the world’s oceans.</p><h3><strong>Meet Dempsey Narkle, Tuuli Narkle Father</strong></h3><p>The phrase “Daddy’s girl” is one that Tuuli Narkle frequently uses on social media. The only thing we do know about her father, though, is his name: Dempsey Narkle.</p><p>Dempsey appears to be working as an Aboriginal artist from Perth.</p><p><img alt=Tuulie-Narkle-Father-Dempsey-Narkle width=294 height=300 data-sizes="(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Tuulie-Narkle-Father-Dempsey-Narkle-294x300.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Before that, he was an Aboriginal football player playing for <a href=#>South Fremantle Football Club</a>.

Born on the day of love is so fitting for you, with everything life throws at you good or bad you approach it with an open mind and with your incredibly open heart, always willing to go that extra mile. Thank you for giving me the gift of you as my mumma. I love you. & HAPPY VALENTINES DAY. Xo.”</p><p>Since October 12th, 2016, Sanna has worked as a union industrial organizer, and as of June 2023, she was still employed.
