Published on May 29, 2020   2 min read The Office almost included a cameo by Dwight Schrute‘s UK counterpart, but the moment never played out on screen, unfortunately. During the May 27 Office Ladies podcast, Jenna Fischer revealed the details of how that meeting was supposed to happen but a scheduling conflict prevented the cameo from becoming a reality."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Michael attempts to throw a party in his hotel room as he struggles with wondering why Jim left Scranton. Jim seems to have bonded with his new boss Josh and that doesn’t sit well with Michael.</p><p id=par-3_52>Back in Scranton, Pam is now single so Kelly sets her up on a date but she doesn’t have a love connection when she goes on a double date with Ryan and Kelly. Jim reveals to Michael that he didn’t leave the Scranton branch because of him but because Pam rejected him.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2>There was almost a meeting of the Dwights (UK and American)</h2><p id=par-4_46>“The Convention” episode could have been even more entertaining if a cameo had worked out. The plan was that the UK Office’s “Dwight” character Gareth Keenan, played by Mackenzie Crook, would be at the convention in a booth and he and Dwight would have a run-in.</p><p id=par-5_24>Alas, there were scheduling issues, so fans never got to see this epic idea play out. Can you imagine the exchange between Dwight and Gareth?</p><p id=par-6_59>Crook was in town doing a press junket for Pirates of the Caribbean so they hoped they could get him for the episode. Unfortunately, that didn’t work out, Fischer explained on <a href=#>Office Ladies</a>. “The scheduling did not work out, he couldn’t come,” Fischer shared. “He couldn’t come. He wanted to… he’s the nicest guy, I’ve met him, he’s awesome.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2>Dwight and Gareth did eventually meet</h2><p id=par-7_39>While Dwight and Gareth never shared the screen on The Office, the two actors did eventually meet in person. In November 2018, actor <a href=#>Rainn Wilson</a>, who played Dwight, met Crook backstage when Crook appeared in the play The Seagull.</p><p id=par-8_42>The Office did get a bit of a crossover with the British version in season 7 episode 14, titled “The Seminar.” In the episode, Michael bumps into David Brent from the original Office, in a brief cameo played by Ricky Gervais.</p><p id=par-9_77>In the brief scene, David exits the elevator and he has an exchange with Michael, who says he’s working on a British character. The two then exchange impersonations of a politically incorrect character and discuss how people don’t accept those kinds of impressions. David drops a “that’s what she says” line and Michael, thoroughly appreciating the reference, gives him a hug. David asks Michael if the company is currently hiring and Michael says “not right now.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMqJ2foZOaeqXDyKCfrWWRobqwv9NmpJ6sXZ22tHnBq6CtoaOdeqS71Kernqqglr%2B1ec6nZGpllaW2tLvDnmSbraRiwamx2GaaqK2cmbu1ec%2Buo6Vln5uzbsDHnmSeqJmYeqStzJ6mZ6Ckorlw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
