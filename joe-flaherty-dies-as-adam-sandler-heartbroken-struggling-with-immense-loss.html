In life, he was simply the funniest man in the room. I just adored him.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-adam-sandler-leads-tributes-for-the-star>Adam Sandler leads tributes for the star</h2><p>Although Sandler and Flaherty worked together in 1996’s Happy Gilmore, the Uncut Gems star had ‘worshipped’ the comedian growing up. Sharing photos of the late star in his heyday, the actor wrote: “Oh man. Worshipped Joe growing up. Always had me and my brother laughing.</p><p>“Count Floyd, Guy Caballero. Any move he made. He crushed as border guard in Stripes. Couldn’t be more fun to have him heckle me on the golf course,” referring to the hilarious moment in the 1996 film.</p><p>“The nicest guy you could know. Genius of a comedian. And a true sweetheart. Perfect combo. Much love to his kids and thanks to Joe for all the greatness he gave us all,” the 57-year-old emotionally concluded.</p><p>Many fans and celebrities who shared a bunch of laughs with the SCTV star have also taken to X, formerly known as <a href=#>Twitter</a>, to pay tribute.</p><p>“I’ve spent the entire afternoon watching and reposting clips of Joe Flaherty. It’s strange to be made so sad while laughing so much. Thanks for stopping by the planet Joe,” posted actor Dave Foley.</p><p>“As a kid from a small Canadian town with only three channels (one of them in French), I feel like I grew up with Joe Flaherty on my TV screen at least 75% of the time. He will be missed,” penned one fan.</p><p>Jennifer Tilly, who worked with the comedian on The Wrong Guy wrote: “Joe Flaherty played my dad in ‘The Wrong Guy.’ I was so thrilled to be able to work with him. His performance was pitch-perfect. A great comedian. Gone too soon.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2WAcLbOnmSfpJGdsrPA2Gabop2jYq60ecCdmKZlo5a7pbjEq2ShnZGnwaO%2BzqScp2Wjqb%2B2s8aloKefXay2tbSMoqSmnZ6osm64zqyqaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
