Unlike the backpacker lodges and surfing resorts on the country’s coast, Nekupe (or “heaven,” in the local language of Chorotega) is built to immerse travellers in Nicaragua’s little-known inland treasures: horseback riding along a series of lakes and mountains, clay shooting near a babbling brook, or sandboarding down an active volcano.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It also has the goal of teaching moneyed visitors about ANF’s goals—including improving local employment opportunities, sustainable farming, and environmental stewardship. The owners have even reforested 1,300 acres around their property, which had been destroyed by slash-and-burn architecture, and designated the land as a nature reserve, in hopes of conserving and regenerating local flora and fauna.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0">Nicaragua’s Wealthiest Family</h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nekupe was founded by Alfredo and Theresa Pellas, who are among Nicaragua’s wealthiest couples. Alfredo’s great-grandfather made a fortune in shipping and sugar production in the late 1800s, and his brother, Carlos, tasked himself with rebuilding the family’s businesses following the Contra war in 1987.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Alfredo and Theresa are more soft-spoken and private about their wealth than Carlos, who has proudly borne the moniker of Nicaragua’s first billionaire, but the siblings share an eye for hospitality. While Alfredo and Theresa were busy turning ANF into the country’s leading relief and development organisation, Carlos was building the country’s first five-star resort, Mukul.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/04/27/cee62d0a-2b27-11e7-acff-d77f13c4971d_1320x770_172240.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mukul set the standard for luxury in Nicaragua, ensuring that local communities could benefit from the country’s burgeoning travel industry. But Nekupe and ANF take things to another level entirely.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The whole story of ANF is what I call the ‘millennium,’” Alfredo Pellas told Bloomberg. “It’s an economic and business model where we build homes but concentrate on villages,” he said. He doesn’t mean that figuratively.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For ANF, building almost 20,000 homes for low-income families is just step one; providing water management solutions, improving education, and creating access to health care are what constitute a functional village.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/04/27/cebb5b66-2b27-11e7-acff-d77f13c4971d_1320x770_172240.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Once a village is up and running, ANF gives it a tailor-made toolkit to help it thrive. “If the area is good for farming beans, we bring in an expert on beans to increase the productivity of campesino [farming] families,” explained Pellas.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Beans are just one example. He has a team of 29 technical staff to implement a long-term economic strategy for each village; a common theme is replacing slash-and-burn agriculture with sustainably sound and more efficient practises, such as beekeeping, small-scale animal husbandry, or bio-intensive farming.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/04/27/ce197dc8-2b27-11e7-acff-d77f13c4971d_1320x770_172240.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The end goal? Multiplying locals’ income from US$2 a day to upwards of US$10. Only then will Pellas see his work as fully realised.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We’ve managed ANF like a business from the beginning, with internal and external auditors and only 2 per cent dedicated to internal overhead,” he said proudly. He and Theresa cover that overhead personally, while Carlos and other relatives are among the more significant annual donors.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0">Where Philanthropy and Luxury Collide</h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nekupe was never supposed to be part of the ANF story. “We were thinking of it originally as our personal vacation home,” said Alfredo. But it took seven years to build the property, and in that time it evolved its own philanthropic missions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For one thing, it became part of the sustainable farming narrative when the Pellases decided to reforest their 1,300 acres by planting more than 14,000 endemic teak, mahogany, and fruit trees. (The area had been blighted after years of destructive agriculture.) Now it’s designated as a nature reserve, with hopes that habitat restoration will bring back local populations of wild boar, iguanas, monkeys, and native birds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/04/27/cf41a77a-2b27-11e7-acff-d77f13c4971d_1320x770_172240.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Turning Nekupe into a hotel also created a significant source of local employment: 100 per cent of the 143-person staff is Nicaraguan, with 80 per cent coming from the immediate community of Nandaime. With just eight rooms, they form a staff-to-guest ratio of 9 to 1.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/04/27/ce8e8a64-2b27-11e7-acff-d77f13c4971d_1320x770_172240.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Rooms, which start at US$750 per night (and come with meals), include four suites in the main house, each with spacious proportions and sumptuous, masculine furnishings: tufted leather headboards, dark-stained wood walls, gabled ceilings, and wall-to-wall windows. And four standalone villas are each themed after local trees, using either the wood, fruit, or scent of indigenous species such as the madroño and jicaro.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We wanted our clients to have very high-end luxurious accommodations that blend in with nature,” said Pellas, adding that “every move we made during construction, we made with respect to nature and the trees.”</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0">An Escape From the World</h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">No, your stay is not a sales pitch for ANF. And the room rates don’t turn into automatic ANF donations. In fact, the hotel and the foundation are registered separately and treated as different businesses. You can come here with zero social agenda and have a perfectly undisturbed getaway with no heavy-handed reminders of the real world outside Nekupe’s five-star bubble.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Pellas believes that subtle exposure to ANF’s missions—be it interactions with the staff, an afternoon picking endemic crops in the property greenhouse, or a visit to the local school—will give travellers a deeper connection to the country they’re visiting. So he’s creating a series of programmes, showcased in beautifully branded materials in each room, that allow guests to visit or volunteer with a series of ANF-funded projects.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I imagine the type of clientele that we attract are also sensitive to the things that are happening in the places that they visit,” said Pellas, pointing to a growing class of socially engaged travellers. He thinks highly of his guests, both intellectually and professionally, imagining they’ll offer him support in the shape of both donations and creative problem-solving skills—say, a cost-effective connection for solar panels. Whatever people are interested in personally, he said, is a springboard for possible contributions with ANF, monetary or otherwise. And if one of those travellers happens to be the chief executive officer of a company looking to boost its charitable giving, he’ll consider it icing on a very tall, very carefully crafted cake.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“People can come here and enjoy Nicaragua, see how good the Nicaraguan people are, the tremendous character they have in everything they do,” he said. “And maybe then they will say, ‘OK, how can I help?’ Every client and every donation stands to change our country tremendously.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZq2qkauyrXnFqKadZ5Gnwaqvy55ma2hpZn54fo6uo62qkWKyua%2FLrqqirpViv6a%2FzqurZqaZmK6zrcaumGaglaG9tHnLrq%2Buqqliuqax0w%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
