Sources told TMZ that MJ, Reza Farahan and Golnesa "GG" Gharachedaghi had been tapped for future projects with Bravo.</p><p>Lewis and his producers pressed Javid on exactly "how many" of her co-stars received a pleasant phone call from Bravo. MJ said "half" of the cast, to which Jeff pointed out that half of the cast would be three stars. Javid replied, coyly, "I'm not that good at counting. I'm not that good at math."</p><p>Lewis, true to form, continued to press, at one point asking, "So<strong> </strong>then would you be potentially working with Bravo on another show then? Is that the good news that you got [on the] phone call?"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:73deca57-e0ed-483a-b728-d7769f9a6be1 data-container-ref=toofab:article:681925d7-cabd-4d7f-83ad-54a748fd5040 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f5/5by4/2021/11/03/f5e2c12d8bc04d218b2604b6f2ffed6c_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Shahs of Sunset's Golnesa 'GG' Gharachedaghi Reveals Polyamorous Relationship</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In reply, Javid said with a laugh, "I hope and pray that being here today doesn't jeopardize anything in my future."</p><p>After Jeff then said "it sounds like you're in talks potentially you're in talks or maybe more," MJ finally offered something that appeared to be a confirmation. She agreed with Lewis, saying, "Maybe more."</p><p>Speaking about her appearance, Javid alluded to a possible return to television, saying, "Maybe I look good because I'm trying to stay ready for camera. Don't you think my waist looks a little bit more in today?"</p><p>However, when Jeff asked MJ if -- "hypothetically" -- there was a new show in the works, what it would look like, Javid said, "If there was gonna be a new show, I would imagine that they would focus on the people that were, you know, bringing it."</p><p>"This is what I do feel from my heart is that our show was such a small cast of just a few of us," she explained. "It started out with two best friends from childhood, right? Me and Reza and GG and the other people have come and go."</p><p>MJ also alluded that <a href=#>Mike Shouhed</a> wouldn't be involved in the new project, noting that he has "a building of real estate stuff going on" and has "some personal stuff going on."</p><p>Meanwhile, speaking of Shouhed and his "personal stuff going on," the reality star was arrested for an alleged domestic violence incident on March 27. According to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Page Six</a>, which first reported the news, Mike was arrested for "intimate partner violence with injury" and charged with corporal injury on a spouse or cohabitant, per the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department.</p><p>The real estate broker's attorney, Alex Kessel, issued a statement to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, saying, "My own investigation reveals no acts of domestic violence was committed by my client. I have no doubt Mike will be exonerated. Please honor the presumption of innocence."</p><p>During her appearance on "Jeff Lewis Live," MJ was asked about the allegations against Mike and his arrest. Javid reacted to the news, saying she's "never, ever, ever seen him violent and I've never seen him be angry."</p><p>"I was shocked because I think that unless I was literally in the room a witness to it ... innocent until proven guilty."</p><a id=gallery-link-bfb257c5-1318-4231-ae9f-e1bb6d93f370 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:bfb257c5-1318-4231-ae9f-e1bb6d93f370 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:681925d7-cabd-4d7f-83ad-54a748fd5040 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f1/4by3/2022/01/08/f1cfacc1aeb940a393e8e678da895762_md.jpeg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j21mampforduvsSamq2rXam8br%2FHmp%2BsZZ%2BberTBzaycrWWTlrukscuaq6KnnmK6qrfEZqqhp6WdsqV5w6iknquknrBuwsioo56mk5p6orjLnp6arJmku7R7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
