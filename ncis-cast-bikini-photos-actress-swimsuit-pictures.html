The series regular and her costars are always sharing gorgeous <a href=#>bikini photos</a> on social media for all of their fans to see.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Katrina became a full-time cast member on</span><i><span> NCIS</span></i><span> in 2021 for season 19 after serving as a guest star in season 18. She was excited to join the police procedural drama because she had been watching the show for many years.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I have been a fan of </span><i><span>NCIS</span></i><span> for a long time,” the Pennsylvania native reflected on landing her dream role in a March 2022 interview with </span><a href=#><span>CherryPicks</span></a><span>. “During my downtime, while filming </span><i><span>Arrow</span></i><span> in Vancouver, I would binge-watch back-to-back episodes of </span><i><span>NCIS</span></i><span>. But now, to know that I am a part of the No. 1 show in the world, the legacy that is </span><i><span>NCIS</span></i><span>, is daunting, humbling and exciting beyond belief.”</span></p><p><span>On top of balancing her demanding schedule portraying Jessica Knight on the show, Katrina is a mom to one daughter, <a href=#>Kinley</a>, whom she welcomed in December 2018 with her husband, </span><b>Keith Andreen</b><span>. The </span><i><span>Hawaii Five-0 </span></i><span>alum revealed that her role on </span><i><span>NCIS</span></i><span> has given her some important takeaways.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“A good actor always extensively researches a role so they can portray it accurately, so I have definitely done my homework,” she said. “The research and the skills I have picked up on hostage negotiation tactics will ultimately help me to navigate my daughter’s toddler years with more efficiency.”</span></p><p><span>She joined the cast full of scene-stealers, including</span><b> Mark Harmon</b><span>, </span><b>Wilmer Valderrama</b><span>, </span><b>Diona Reasonover</b><span>, </span><b>Gary Cole</b><span> and more. Many other stars have also made names for themselves during their time on the show like </span><b>Emily Wickersham</b><span>, </span><b>Lauren Holly</b><span>, </span><b>Jennifer Esposito</b><span>, </span><b>Cote de Pablo</b><span> and </span><b>Sasha Alexander</b><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Emily, a franchise favorite, announced her departure from the series in May 2021 in a candid Instagram post.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Hangin’ this hat and jacket up. What a great ride it’s been,” she captioned a photo from the </span><i><span>NCIS</span></i><span> set. “This cast, this crew, are top notch. I can’t say enough kind words about this group that I’ve had the pleasure of working with for close to eight years now and 172 episodes later.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Shortly after her shocking career announcement, Emily revealed she was pregnant with her first child by sharing a poolside bikini snap with her baby bump on full display. The </span><i><span>Gossip Girl</span></i><span> alum has since become a mom to her son, Cassius, whom she welcomed in December 2021 with her husband, </span><b>James Badge Dale</b><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Keep scrolling to see bikini photos of the </b><b><i>NCIS </i></b><b>cast.</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46nmqKrXZiutMCMm6CkoZ6eerG0zq2mrGWRmMGzsdKsZKyvmaLAtrXTZqeim6Sqv6a%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
