The second round of acts for Open Mic on &#34;Bring the Funny&#34; definitely had some stronger moments, but it also reminded us why we have huge beef with NBC right now.
Last week, Harry & Chris advanced and we couldn't figure out why. A couple of days later, NBC decided to put up their full performance, and now we get it."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Seriously, check out the full song below and see how it's actually funny.</p><p>So the question is why NBC can't just put up the full performances of all ten acts on the show's YouTube page. Hell, this week they didn't even put up full acts that they aired on television. There are five clips from this week's show and one was previewed a day early. What is going on over there?!</p><p>"World of Dance" embraced the digital platform so fans could enjoy the full acts, and it gave them a reason to go online after watching the show on television. "BTF" needs to get it together and bring us all the funny!</p><p>That said, there were some really great acts tonight, and some that at least seemed to not be so great. Once again, we disagree a bit with the judges, but then again, they saw more than we did. Yes, we're not over this yet!</p><p>Who do I think I am? you ask. Well, I spent nearly a decade of my life sweating and bleeding to the music as a dancer. From a young boy learning a shuffle-ball-change to performing with the St. Louis Ballet Company, I experienced the ups and downs of one of the most difficult physically demanding sports on the planet. During this time, I was also a member of the St. Louis Symphony Youth Orchestra, as well as a gymnast, writer and cartoonist. I had a lot more energy in my younger years. And I've spent the last seventeen years analyzing and critiquing reality competition shows for various media publications. I've got this.</p><p>Fair warning, since I'm safe at home, I'm probably going to be a little harsher than my colleagues <strong><a href=#>Kenan Thompson</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Chrissy Teigen</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Jeff Foxworthy</a></strong>. But I might be nicer, too. Maybe. For this round, I'm gonna rank them from worst to first to see who emerges as my top six each week.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:4e342027-33d3-5b8e-bd95-1a29b2d70846 data-container-ref=toofab:article:1e52ccc8-6cf5-51ac-8f04-75f9db9a6d85 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/44/5by4/2019/07/17/449b6ad2130d53f2903f630233866457_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">NBC</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'America's Got Talent' 5th Judge: Brad Paisley's Golden Buzzer Is Inspiration for a New Generation</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>ISMO</h2><p>(stand-up) He worked way too hard to get to the "seven is silent" punchline. If you're going to spend time in a bit, you have to be funny and entertaining or at least interesting the whole way, and ISMO had way too many misfires.</p><h2 class=h2>Daphnique Springs</h2><p>(stand-up) Daphnique just needs to work on tightening up her writing and her delivery, but playing with her real OCD in her material is the right direction for her to be going. This just felt like someone still working on their craft than a polished comedian ready for the big show.</p><h2 class=h2>Regan & Watkins</h2><p>(variety) This song only dipped into the very surface of 21st Century boys and girls and lost out on a chance to be sharp satire and good commentary in its funny. Instead, it was bottom-feeding nonsense that didn't really go anywhere and lacked any comedic punch.</p><h2 class=h2>Willy Appelman</h2><p>(sketch) Willy came out as some kind of '80s dance instructor by way of Richard Simmons and it was utterly bizarre. He had a few good quips along the way, but the whole act was more exhausting than it was hilarious. It started off great, but started to grate.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:6b64a6d8-20b2-56a7-a217-9c65bf9a59b0 data-container-ref=toofab:article:1e52ccc8-6cf5-51ac-8f04-75f9db9a6d85 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/32/5by4/2019/07/15/3208315f7b515aa2b02b030026ad8a1f_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">MTV</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'Ex on the Beach' Premiere: Aubrey O'Day Calls Donald Trump Jr. Her 'Soul Mate,' Gets Caught In 'Big Brother' Drama</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>TOP 6</h2><h2 class=h2>Room 28</h2><p>(sketch) This was just kind of a mess from start to finish. None of the performers were great in their roles, and they went the laziest route with their impressions of Pitbull, Ne-Yo and Cardi B. Pitbull as a roommate had potential to be funny, but it felt totally squandered.</p><h2 class=h2>Mandy Muden</h2><p>(variety) Her "Mary Poppins" schtick did wear a little thin, but her charm is undeniable and she did pull off a legitimately impressive card trick. A little more tightening of this material and she could have a really special act on her hands. She was definitely one of the more memorable performers on the night.</p><h2 class=h2>Morgan Jay</h2><p>(variety) We were digging on his rap-sung delivery but he kind of lost us when he started interacting with the judges. It all became very stereotypical of relationship jokes and the games women supposedly play. The interaction with Kenan and Jeff was good, though.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:585519dc-9b2b-5459-882b-a424cb4c89f4 data-container-ref=toofab:article:1e52ccc8-6cf5-51ac-8f04-75f9db9a6d85 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/0a/5by4/2019/07/16/0af36357132d5362bb8be920350eb6dd_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">MTV/Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'The Hills' Recap: How Brody Jenner Really Feels About Caitlyn Jenner Bailing On His Wedding</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>Michael Longfellow</h2><p>(stand-up) HIs intro package was lame, so we didn't have much hope for Michael, and he did tread familiar territory talking about remembering showering with his father as a baby. But it was how he approached it that felt fresh and interesting, and he managed to build his whole set around this memory. Good craftsmanship and a solid, if uninspiring, delivery.</p><h2 class=h2>Jesus Trejo</h2><p>(stand-up) A great delivery and confident stage presence, Jesus was polish from top to bottom. And there's clearly as many jokes in his grandmother having 21 kids as there were kids. It would have been fun to play more with the juxtaposition of him being an only child in that family, but maybe for future sets. He did the right thing in that we want to know and see more.</p><h2 class=h2>Randy Feltface</h2><p>(variety) What an unusual act, this guy does basic stand-up but as a puppet. And you know what? It really worked. It helps that his material was really sharp, but he was a great puppeteer on top of it, putting emotion and performance into Randy as much as his vocal work. It was surprisingly strong.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:df0de120-51ec-5201-b8c4-67ddb2d81fa3 data-container-ref=toofab:article:1e52ccc8-6cf5-51ac-8f04-75f9db9a6d85 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/8b/5by4/2019/07/17/8bf8f66ef94659658778c8f23be9bddd_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">STX Entertainment</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jennifer Lopez Leads Cardi B and Criminal Stripper Crew Taking on Wall Street in 'Hustlers' Trailer</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>RESULTS</h2><p>NBC is driving us crazy by not posting all of these video clips and letting us see all these acts, but our picks for Top 6 did at least get a full representation on the show. But, maybe like Harry & Chris last week, some of the best material was left on the cutting room floor.</p><p>The judges put through <strong>Morgan Jay</strong>, <strong>Michael Longfellow</strong>, <strong>Willy Appelman</strong>, <strong>Jesus Trejo</strong>, <strong>ISMO</strong> and <strong>Randy Feltface.</strong> So now we're wondering if ISMO's whole act was a lot stronger than the part we saw, and the same for Willy Appelman, who left us underwhelmed.</p><p>For the record, we're not upset that Room 28 and Mandy Muden didn't make it, as we didn't think there were a lot of strong acts on the night overall. These were just two we felt had potential that could grow.</p><p>Our final note is for NBC to take advantage of the digital platform and put all ten acts up there so viewers at home can see what got cut for time. People love "Digital Exclusives," and you still get revenue from those ads, too. It's a win-win-win!</p><p>"Bring the Funny" airs Tuesdays at 10 p.m. ET on NBC.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
