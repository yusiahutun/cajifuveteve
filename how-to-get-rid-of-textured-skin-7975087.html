Those with oilier skin may experience more blemishes and bumps, while those on the drier side can experience roughness and flakiness. Of course, combination skin can have the “best” of both worlds with slicker, oilier areas and dryness elsewhere.</p><p>Certain skin conditions can also lead to textured skin, such as eczema, psoriasis, and dermatitis, which can be uncomfortable and frustrating to treat. Some people find that changing weather or hormonal patterns can worsen these symptoms, especially in the colder months.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-causes-of-textured-skin></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Causes of Textured Skin</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Linda N. Lee, M.D.</a>, a double-board certified facial plastic and reconstructive surgeon, breaks the causes of textured skin into four categories: genetic, environmental, hormonal, and age-related.</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Genetics</strong>: Genetic reasons for textured skin include enlarged pores, dry or oily skin, and conditions like eczema, which can cause irregular skin texture that we are born with.</li><li><strong>Environmental</strong>: Sun damage from UV rays, including natural sunlight and (worse!) tanning beds, is one of the most common causes of thickened and “leathery” skin. Smoking and air pollution can also contribute to poor skin texture.</li><li><strong>Hormonal</strong>: Teenagers, pregnant patients, and perimenopausal patients all have skin conditions that can be treated specifically in different life stages. Hormonal changes can result in acne-prone skin, oily or dry skin, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>melasma</a> during pregnancy (“pregnancy skin”), and skin thinning, resulting in easier breakage.</li><li><strong>Age</strong>: Skin turns over less as you mature. Fine lines and dull skin tone can result from this. Everyone will have collagen breakdown over each decade, and eventually, skin that is saggier and more coarse with deeper wrinkles.</li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Other related factors that can cause textured skin include acne scars, skin conditions, and poor skincare habits. These factors can lead to a rough, uneven skin surface with fine lines, wrinkles, or scars, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Kautilya Shaurya, MD</a>, a board-certified dermatologist. “To address textured skin, it’s crucial to identify the underlying cause and seek appropriate treatments, skincare routines, or a dermatologist’s recommendation for improvement,” he says.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-treat-textured-skin-at-home></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Treat Textured Skin at Home</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Addressing textured skin can start at home with over-the-counter or prescription treatments. Here’s what works best, according to the experts.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Topical Retinoids&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The single best at-home treatment option is a vitamin A derivative (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>topical retinol</a> or retinoids) to help reduce collagen breakdown and treat fine lines,” says Dr. Lee. Retinoids are derivatives of vitamin A that are converted into retinoic acid for skincare, helping boost skin cell turnover and improving the look and feel of skin texture.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are several doses and types of topical retinol, including over-the-counter, medical grade, and prescription strength. Not everyone can tolerate retinol, but it is essential to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>start at a low dose</a> and slowly work up to the best quantity you can handle without significant peeling, according to Dr. Lee. “I think of it like exercise: rather than running 3 hours once a month, it is better to exercise routinely for 30 minutes three times a week. You want to do the best dose you can tolerate regularly that is sustainable and does not cause too much dryness or redness,” she explains.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The best dose for you will be unique to your skin’s needs and tolerance. “It is great to work with a board-certified skin care provider to find the best regimen for your skin type,” says Dr. Lee.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Chemical Exfoliating Acids</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Chemical exfoliants increase the rate of cell turnover by encouraging the skin to produce new, healthy cells,” says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Connie Yang, MD</a>, cosmetic dermatologist at PFRANKMD by Dr. Paul Jarrod Frank.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This process helps to replace damaged or dull skin with a fresher, smoother skin over time. Look for products containing alpha hydroxy acids (i.e., glycolic acid, lactic acid), which help break down the bonds between dead skin cells to reveal smoother and more even skin, according to Dr. Yang.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Antioxidants and Hydrators</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Antioxidants improve cell health and protect the skin against sun damage, while hydrators soothe and plump dry, damaged skin, making the duo a powerful defense against textured skin. Dullness and peeling, in particular, can be brightened and resolved with antioxidants, including vitamin C, and hydrators such as hyaluronic acid, according to Dr. Baron.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Some inflammatory skin diseases can also improve with potent antioxidants such as green tea and hyaluronic acid, as well as some oils like coconut, macadamia, and kukui nut oils,” says Dr. Baron.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-in-office-treatments-for-textured-skin></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>In-Office Treatments for Textured Skin</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Treating textured skin with the help of in-office treatments can help you get smoother skin when at-home treatments aren’t enough or when you’re looking for a more dramatic change.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Chemical Peels</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Depending on the underlying cause of poor skin texture, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>chemical peels</a> can help accentuate your at-home regimen, according to Dr. Lee. These exfoliating treatments are a step up from the at-home versions, similarly exfoliating and improving the skin’s texture, using powerful acids to peel off the top layer of skin, revealing the fresh, smooth, bright skin beneath.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Microneedling</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Microneedling</a>, also called Dermapen and Rejuvapen, helps produce collagen and thicken the skin for a more youthful, plump, and even appearance. Essentially, needles are inserted into the skin to create tiny puncture wounds on the skin’s topmost layer, triggering the skin to produce collagen and elastin in response.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another option is microneedling with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>platelet-rich plasma</a> (PRP), which uses your own growth-protein-containing plasma to stimulate collagen production, wound healing, and cell renewal. “Microneedling with PRP is often very helpful when performed in three treatments for smoothing irregularities, brightening skin tone, and even softening old acne scars,” says Dr. Lee.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Facelifts and Eyelid Surgery</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“For the person with a lot of skin laxity related to age and irregularities in the skin, in-office facelifts and eyelid surgery can be performed to remove the excess skin and tighten the underlying facial musculature and overlying skin,” says Dr. Lee.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fillers and Injectibles&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Facial fillers</a> (including Restylane and Juvederm) can help plump skin and restore volume to the aging face, according to Dr. Lee. Biostimulating injectable treatments such as Sculptra (often called a “liquid facelift”) can help stimulate facial collagen. These treatments stimulate collagen production for gradual texture improvement.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-skin-care-routines-for-textured-skin></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Skin-Care Routines for Textured Skin</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">An effective skincare routine for textured skin aims to promote skin renewal, improve hydration, and minimize the appearance of unevenness.
