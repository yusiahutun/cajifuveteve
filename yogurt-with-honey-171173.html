We all crave a little something sweet from time to time, so instead of giving it up cold turkey, we suggest replacing your daily treat with a healthier option. Greek yogurt with honey is a simple snack that will not only satisfy your sweet tooth, but boost your gut health, and yes, help you lose weight.&nbsp;</p><p>Greek yogurt is <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">full of gut-healing probiotic cultures</a> which aid digestion and <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">have even shown</a> to improve the symptoms of gastrointestinal disorders like constipation, IBS, and colon cancer. And of course, we know that <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">healthy digestion and elimination</a> is a key factor if you’re looking to lose weight!</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>On its own, honey is <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">loaded with antioxidants </a>which are shown to improve cardiovascular health and help ward off a wide array of diseases. Honey also contains high concentrations of key nutrients like manganese and iron, which are both essential to many of the body’s functions. Even more impressively, consuming honey has <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">been linked to lower levels of LDL or “bad” cholesterol</a> and triglycerides, while improving levels of HDL or “good” cholesterol — that means a healthier heart!</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spicy Honey Is the Sweet-Hot Cure for Coughs, Congestion + Sore Throat, Say MDs</a></p><p>Though Greek yogurt and honey are both superfood powerhouses, putting them together makes things even better. While the sweetness of the honey puts cravings to rest, you’ll also be benefiting from a hefty amount of protein from the yogurt which will <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">boost satiety</a> to keep you feeling full — and may even <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">help to reduce body fat</a>! The fat in the <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">yogurt will also help to slow down the absorption of the glucose</a> (sugar) in the honey, so you don’t experience a blood sugar spike. This pair is clearly a match made in heaven.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>If You Suffer From Bloating, Constipation and Blue Moods, This SIBO Yogurt May Be the Delicious Cure You’ve Been Waiting For</a></p><p>You want the yogurt to have as much as 15 grams of protein per serving, the plain Greek yogurt by Fage (<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$3.49, Amazon Fresh</a>) is a great option. This tart yogurt pairs perfectly with just a tablespoon of honey for a satisfying, healthy snack. If you want to make your treat even more fun, try adding some low sugar fruit like raspberries or blueberries (which are also loaded with antioxidants) and/or a small amount of your favorite granola! If you’re dieting, however, be mindful of how much you’re adding to your yogurt as you don’t want to load it up with additional calories. Otherwise, go crazy and enjoy the benefits of the sweetest guilt-free snack!&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>More From FIRST</h2><p><a href=#>7 Easy Quinoa Recipes That Actually Taste Good</a></p><p><a href=#>We’ve Been Eating Chia Seeds Wrong — Study Says Grinding Them Boosts Gut Health Benefits</a></p><p><a href=#>Oolong Tea Can Help You Shed Pounds and Blast Belly Bloat</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJonainlGK%2Fpq%2FIqZysZ6mktLa%2B02auoqyYYrWwusSyZGpvYWaEdA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
