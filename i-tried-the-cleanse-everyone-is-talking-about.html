I just completed a ten day cleanse and I feel a slightly thinner and a lot less crave-y. The Purium Cleanse was founded by and formulated by naturopath David Sandoval. It's a ten-day system—which includes shakes, three different kinds of supplements, and an apothe-cherry juice—meant to detox and reset your metabolism.
A fellow editor was recommended the cleanse by her trainer, one who works with multiple high-profile names, so it's definitely in the NYC health conversation."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The Purium Cleanse was founded by and formulated by naturopath David Sandoval.

In the past, I've done one juice cleanse and experienced feeling&nbsp;extremely&nbsp;hungry, slightly incoherent and more than a little angry for three days.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I won't lie and say I wasn't a little hungry having three shakes a day with three cup-sized portions of fruits or vegetables. The mornings were quite a bit easier. I woke up and ate an apple, cherries or watermelon with the pill allotment. Two hours later it's time for a shake, followed by a vegetable with lunch, which was usually a small avocado with cayenne pepper and sea salt, and more pills. At this point, I would still feel fine. Two hours following that, it's time for another shake and pills, followed by a fruit or vegetable two hours later. Around this time&nbsp;is when I would get hungry and wonder where my dinner was. I would have my final shake of the night at home around 7PM. Before bed, you have the cherry juice, mixed with water, which is a nice tart treat that also helps with sleep. My fellow editor had hers in a wine glass because she's fancy. I skipped this one night and was very hungry around 3AM.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At one point, I had a question about my size in comparison to the pills I was supposed to take and Michael Wohlfeld, Purium's Staff Naturopath wrote back in the same day. You're not left to figure it all out on your own.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I wasn't looking to lose a lot of weight on this cleanse. According to the Purium <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.puriumcorp.com/www/home/tenday data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=site class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">site</a>, those partaking can&nbsp;lose 5-20 pounds in ten days. I lost about 4 pounds, which with my small frame seems about right. I already eat quite clean and I'm gluten free, so I wasn't trying to break any bad habits. I recently reignited a workout plan that has been about a year (or more) dormant and wanted to get my body in peak condition going into it. You're not meant to workout aggressively on the cleanse, but since I had just started, even light workouts most likely made me hungrier than I normally would have been.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Since ending it two days ago, I haven't gained any weight back and I don't feel a rabid hunger at lunch that I had been. I went back to eating dairy and fish, no meat or grains yet, and still feel great. Overall, ten days is a very long time, especially when there are parties and dinners happening—I actually went to one birthday dinner and ate only broccoli, which was a little embarrassing. I'd recommend it for a health boost and to get a clean slate—just know you're going to have to hibernate for a bit.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/89754333-a030-4699-b9fa-0dfa137fc094_1496780517.jpg alt="Headshot of Kerry Pieri" title="Headshot of Kerry Pieri" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Kerry Pieri is Harper's Bazaar's Digital Fashion/Features Director.
