While he lived, he had two marriages, with Brenda Hosbrook being his first. Her relationship with the comedian catapulted her to fame, and if death had not interfered, she and Carlin might have lasted a lifetime.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Brenda_Hosbrook_Met_George_Carlin_Before_His_Career_Took_Off></span>Brenda Hosbrook Met George Carlin Before His Career Took Off<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brenda Hosbrook was born in Dayton, Ohio, on August 5, 1936. She met Carlin in 1960 while he was still a budding comedian.&nbsp;The first time they ran into each other, he was on tour with his partner Jack Burns and quickly fell in love with her.&nbsp;</p><p>The pair <a href=#>tied the knot</a> in Daytona, Ohio, on June 3, 1961. During their marriage, Hosbrook was a pillar of support for her husband as he weathered the ups and downs of his career.&nbsp;Hosbrook played a big role in Carlin’s career; she even went as far as to collaborate with him on several of his comedy specials.&nbsp;</p><p>She was initially an associate producer for “George Carlin At Phoenix.” She also wore the producer hat for many of his classics, including “Jammin’ in New York.”&nbsp;Her final work as an executive producer credit was for the special “George Carlin: 40 Years of Comedy in 1997.”&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from her work as a producer, Hosbrook was also a founder of the non-profit theater, The Parkview Stage Co., in Los Angeles.&nbsp;Throughout the 36 years they were married, Carlin always praised Hosbrook for her hard work and celebrated her achievements.&nbsp;</p><p>He believed she was responsible for “inspiring countless others to be their best and realize their dreams.” Their harmony in the studio birthed many great works, and their unity behind closed doors led to the birth of their only child, daughter Kelly, in 1963.&nbsp;Brenda Hosbrook remained with George Carlin until she passed away in May 1997 at age 57, following her battle with liver cancer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/carl.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Carlin_Met_Brenda_Hosbrooks_Replacement_Months_After_Her_Demise></span>Carlin Met Brenda Hosbrook’s Replacement Months After Her Demise&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Carlin loved Hosbrook dearly, and he admired her equally. However, some people raised eyebrows when it was revealed, months after her passing, that the comedian was once more in love.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Carlin, it was love at first sight for him and the woman, Sally Wade. Sally Wade is credited for penning TV shows like “E/R” and “What’s Happening in the 70s and 80s.” Her author bio show she has worked for stars like George Clooney and The Beach Boys, among others. She remained with Carlin until his demise in 2008.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=George_Carlin_Was_Wades_Soulmate></span>George Carlin Was Wade’s Soulmate&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>George Carlin passed away just days before he was to celebrate his 10th marriage anniversary to Sally Wade.&nbsp;After Carlin passed on, Wade shared a heartfelt statement mourning his loss.&nbsp;</p><p>She <a href=#>said</a>: “George Carlin was and always will be the greatest love of my life. We had a meeting of the minds, heart, and spirit. It was a big love. He was my soul mate and always will be.” Wade added that his death was shocking and thanked those who reached out with condolences and prayers.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/g-1024x828.jpg><p>In the years since his demise, Carlin and Brenda Hosbrook’s daughter, Kelly, has honored his legacy in various ways, including remaining active in the comedy world.&nbsp;Kelly has also been very vocal about her parents’ drug and alcohol abuse while they lived. She once stated that their addictions made walking on eggshells around them necessary.&nbsp;</p><p>George Carlin used to stay up for days on cocaine, and her mother would often drink too much to wrestle with a hangover the next day.&nbsp;It’s been years since she had to see something like that, but Kelly has never forgotten how it felt.&nbsp;</p><p>Other stars like Carlin who have had a brush with substance abuse include <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a>, Macaulay Culkin, Seth Rogen, and Robert Downey Jr.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kr7OxzZ2YZqCfqK%2Bzu86kZLCZo2K6or7RopydZaSkeqixzquenmWTlr%2Bttc1mrKesmaF6qbHRZpuepZmosm61zaygnZ1dqbWmtdFmam9lqZqus3nLqKWgZZ2Wv7O1wKCcaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
