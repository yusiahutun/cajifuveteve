While the show has been renewed for a fourth season, Cavill surprised fans by announcing he was leaving it behind, as the streamer confirmed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" title=https://toofab.com/people/liam-hemsworth/><strong>Liam Hemsworth</strong></a> would take over the role.</p><p>"We didn’t know [Cavill was leaving] until after we'd filmed Season 3," she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" title=https://variety.com/2023/tv/global/the-witcher-anya-chalotra-henry-cavill-liam-hemsworth-1235651769/><strong>Variety</strong></a>.</p><p>"I think we will all feel that loss. He's been with us since day one. We've been through a lot together," she continued. "It's been five years of not only this world that we have in The Witcher, but COVID – all these things that we've gone through together, and it's a strong bond.

"So to work with [Cavill], it's a blessing because there are days when you might disbelieve the world a little bit more than the next. And he's there to go, 'Hang on, we've got this.'"</p><p>"Henry is moving on from this, and that's really exciting.

I wasn’t part of that process [of his casting]. But I'm very excited to see what his Geralt is," she shared. "And only then will we realize what dynamics we have as a group."</p><p>"I haven't read anything, so I really do wonder how they're going to bring this character into the audience's life," she added, saying she was "excited" about all the "unknown" to come.</p><p>The third season of The Witcher drops this Friday, June 29 on Netflix on June 29 and will close off Cavill's run as the lead role.
