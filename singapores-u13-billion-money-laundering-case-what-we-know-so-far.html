That figure is likely to be considerably higher now as hot money inflows have continued unabated in the years since.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“On the whole, investors will be watching how Singapore makes resolutions for a better and safer financial locality – it may well turn out to be in the country’s favour if the case is managed well,” said Loh, director of the National University of Singapore’s Centre for Governance and Sustainability.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It will take more than this money laundering happening for Singapore’s reputation as ‘Switzerland of the East’ to really take a serious hit,” he said, referring to the moniker applied to the city state by pundits given its now-entrenched status as one of Asia’s go-to wealth management hubs.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">It will take more than this money laundering happening for Singapore’s reputation as ‘Switzerland of the East’ to really take a serious hitLawrence Loh, governance expert</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even if Singapore were to put all the necessary regulatory frameworks in place, it would not completely eliminate all possibility of money laundering, Loh said, stressing the need for tight enforcement of big-ticket purchases such as club memberships, real estates and luxury cars, which may require a whole-system approach.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“These will be good checkpoints to nip any problems in the bud. But the challenge is the delicate balance between overregulation and being business-friendly,” he said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">What do Singaporeans think?</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The case has rekindled an already intense debate among locals about the island nation’s yawning income and wealth gap. On social media, many juxtaposed the upper-class lifestyles of the 10 suspects – parsing images of the seized Bentleys and homes – with their own struggles amid the rising cost of living.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“While they are enjoying their lavish lifestyles in Singapore for the past six years pumping dirty money into our economy, ordinary Singaporeans pay the price of distorted inflation unknowingly,” read a comment on Facebook in response to a news article about the investigation.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Singapore readies anti-money-laundering system roll out to prevent a 1MDB repeat</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Among the intelligentsia, the money-laundering case has been examined as a symptom of what they call unbridled globalisation and openness to foreign talent and wealth that have come at the expense of locals’ interests.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This trend has resulted in Singapore being seen as a way station by some of its residents, while others see it as a home or a bit of both, according to Sudhir Thomas Vadaketh, editor of weekly magazine Jom.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There’s an inherent existential tension between the two that expresses itself in different ways, and requires perpetual management from politicians and bureaucrats,” Sudhir was quoted as saying in a recent Financial Times report about the case. “The money-laundering case, for many people, reminds us that we may be leaning too much towards ‘global city’.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">What has the government said?</h3>The government has come out to defend the country’s financial system and strongly refuted online speculation that the investigation was conducted at the behest of Beijing, following a recent visit by its <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">foreign minister Wang Yi</span></a> days before police launched their island-wide raids.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The most extensive official comments on the case have come from the law and home affairs minister, K. Shanmugam, in an interview with local Chinese-language daily Lianhe Zaobao.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The veteran minister labelled speculation about Beijing giving the green light to the investigation as “absurd”, stressing that Singapore does not “yield to that sort of pressure from any country”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/09/15/cf198f12-8154-4f65-abd7-ad7f00bd7eb6_5accb148.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said that investigations started because authorities “had reason to believe that these people had committed offences in Singapore”, and not “at the request of some foreign country or party or because of external pressure”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When he was asked about whether the case would dent the country’s reputation as a global financial hub, and could see it become a hotspot for money-laundering activities, he warned against making such characterisations and said that similar activities occurred in other financial centres like London and Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s like a major highway. Some criminals will also try and use the highway, and they will try different methods, quite sophisticated, they’ll mix some illegal transactions with many legitimate ones, to make it difficult for you to find, so that it’s not always clear cut,” he said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘People are having doubts’: is Hong Kong losing its edge to Singapore as legal hub?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The bottom line was that by taking action as soon as the authorities had the facts, Singapore sent “a clear signal that we are a no-nonsense place”, Shanmugam said. “We’ll act against people who abuse our system.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Heng Swee Keat, one of the republic’s two deputy prime ministers, echoed this view at a Forbes conference in the city state this week, saying that Singapore had been “vigilant” about illicit activities such as money laundering, in response to a question about the case.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Financial centres all over the world will face this challenge, because so much money is moving around,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In fact, if at all, it is a call for all of us to be very vigilant because every transaction will have a financial element, and the fact that we are vigilant is a plus and we have every intention to keep it that way.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZL2wuMitoJyrX5a%2FtbXCpZxoa2JogXh9kmiqoqaXlr2wvsSsZK5pY2KvqrjLoqanZZ2ku6bFjKWYrqaUmr%2BqusZmmpqrlWLEqa3TZq6eZZujvLh50qhkn5mi</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
