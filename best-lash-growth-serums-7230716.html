And what’s not to love? Longer lashes open up your eyes, making them appear larger, youthful, and more vibrant. Many femme-presenting people go a long way to get that alluring pop in the eye, be it with lash curlers, volumizing mascara, lash extensions, or faux lashes. But the most effective and longest lasting way to land the long lashes of your dreams is with a lash growth serum. With consistency and a few daily strokes of a hyper-targeted formula along your lash line, you can get gorgeous, healthy and fuller looking lashes in just a few weeks.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If it sounds too good to be true (which to be honest, we thought at first as well), it’s not. We tested 30 of the most popular lash growth serums over a span of ten weeks to evaluate which ones made our lashes feel stronger, look longer, and appear more fuller and voluminous. We judged each lash growth serum based on how easy they were to use and how quickly the serum absorbed into the lash line, as well as the degree to which they strengthened and lengthened our lashes, and finally, the way our lashes looked overall after using the serum for ten weeks. To earn a spot on our list, each serum also needed to be safe for sensitive eyes.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-borboleta-lash-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Borboleta Lash Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Borboleta Lash Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/LF6RhZVQCGFhdGO7w2PvWA1OVhs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Borboleta-Lash-Serum-cf49f634843a45659731759d69ae9390.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Borboleta</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Strengthening</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Lengthening</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Sensitivity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Every detail of this product was carefully considered, earning it the best overall. From Borboleta's chic packaging to the serum’s easy application process, to the lightweight consistency of the formula, to the stunning final result, we were impressed from start to finish.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The applicator brush resembles the tip of a liquid eyeliner so you can easily reach the lash line in a single, targeted sweep that won’t drip down your eyelid. It absorbed quickly into our skin and didn’t leave a sticky residue in its wake. And after eight weeks of consistently applying the serum, we not only noticed that our lashes were considerably longer (so much so that we received compliments from strangers on the sidewalk!), but it made our lashes curl upward as well.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In terms of strength, we noticed our lashes weren’t falling out as much as usual, which to us meant that they were growing in stronger. The look of our lashes improved so significantly after using this serum that we no longer need to spend time curling or priming — all we have to do is swipe on mascara and boom, we have the perfect lashes.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Biotin, keratin, peptides, pumpkin seed extract<strong> |&nbsp;Usage: </strong>Once a day at night<strong> | Results: </strong>8 weeks <strong>| Size: </strong>3 ml | <strong>Ophthalmologist-Tested: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-revitalash-cosmetics-advanced-eyelash-conditioner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>RevitaLash Cosmetics Advanced Eyelash Conditioner</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="RevitaLash Cosmetics Advanced Eyelash Conditioner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/pA7GGT7_CrvDSs2DBGtSgHJ4v4w=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/revitalash-advanced-eyelash-2e45beda35f74580bf096adc1d30fdb7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Strengthening</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Lengthening</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Sensitivity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Yes, the RevitaLash conditioner is a bit of a splurge item, but believe us when we say these make your eyelashes so long (we noticed them double in length) that you won’t even be able to see the price tag through your new luscious lashes. And it worked fast — we saw results in a mere four weeks, which was speedier than any other serum on this list.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s so much to love here: The soft brush feels smooth across the delicate lash line and no product goes to waste as it sinks into skin quickly without running. While the lengthening capabilities are close to magic, it does little to increase the amount of actual hair strands on your lash line.&nbsp;But trust us, you'll never get sick of your friends asking where you got your “lash extensions” from (or at least we didn't!).<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Peptides, lipids, biotin, green tea extract<strong> |&nbsp;Usage: </strong>Once a day<strong> | Results: </strong>4 weeks <strong>| Size: </strong>2 ml | <strong>Ophthalmologist-Tested: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-maybelline-lash-sensational-boosting-eyelash-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Maybelline Boosting Eyelash Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Maybelline Lash Sensational Boosting Eyelash Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/P_RhU1vJ2pL9UPg_1LiodWSkeSs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/maybelline-lash-sensational-serum-d35b321be97f41bdbbc7b2c5a669a2fc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Strengthening</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Lengthening</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Sensitivity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The price of lash growth serums have quite the range (a few we tested went into the hundreds!), yet we were delightfully shocked at the value this itty bitty $10 lash serum provided to visibly strengthen our eyelashes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re not looking for a dramatic increase in lash length, but rather a natural fullness, this Maybelline lash boosting serum may be your perfect match. After a few weeks of consistent use, it provided us with the youthful, healthy look of a person who drinks lots of water and eats all the leafy greens (instead of someone who just walked out of a lash appointment).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The applicator brush looks like a miniature mascara wand to apply the product from the base of your eyelash through the tip. One sweep leaves them looking glossy (an added bonus we love) and if you’re a fan of the no-makeup-makeup vibe, you can skip mascara altogether. Just be sure to let the serum dry down on lashes and avoid rubbing, which can cause slight irritation.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Arginine, pro-vitamin B5<strong> |&nbsp;Usage: </strong>Twice a day<strong> | Results: </strong>4 weeks<strong> | Size: </strong>5.32 ml | <strong>Ophthalmologist-Tested: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-on-amazon-grande-cosmetics-grandelash-md-lash-enhancing-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best on Amazon</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Grande Cosmetics Lash Enhancing Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH MD Lash Enhancing Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/MEZ2Yj7dbdejn-uFc_ARaMSXPco=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/grande-cosmetics-grandelash-md-lash-enhancing-serum-d4f484510347431388b6cea2e435fdc0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Strengthening</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Lengthening</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>2</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Sensitivity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We tested this serum on both our lashes and eyebrows, and the difference between our before and after photos were positively striking.&nbsp;Our hair grew in noticeably fuller, thicker, and all-over healthier. While our lashes and brows were definitely more voluminous, we did notice that the length did not change too much, making this product a match for those looking for an extra boost of lash strength, rather than length.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There were a few times that we overzealously applied the serum, causing it to slightly drip into our eye, which stung for a second. However, it’s easy to avoid this mistake if you apply a modest amount on the thin applicator, and run it over the top of your lash line. While it might be tempting to dose your lashes with the product, you definitely want to avoid doing so with this formula. Other than that, we experienced zero irritation or redness around the eye.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Amino acids, hyaluronic acids, vitamin E, botanical extracts <strong>| Usage: </strong>Once daily<strong> | Results: </strong>4-6 weeks <strong>| Size: </strong>2.1 ml<strong> |&nbsp;Ophthalmologist-Tested: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-strengthening-lancme-cils-booster-lash-revitalizing-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Strengthening</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lancôme Lash Revitalizing Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lanc&amp;ocirc;me Cils Booster Lash Revitalizing Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/3uf6MKtCt7ghgpyE-sjmLI3aOgQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lancome-cils-booster-bd89986270e443e388a99b164fe0eccd.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Strengthening</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Lengthening</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Sensitivity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Before testing this serum, our lashes would fall out from the slightest bit of friction, whether from rubbing an eye itch or removing eye makeup. Yet, just after a few uses of Lancôme's lash growth serum, we began to notice that our lashes were not only less prone to breakage, but that overall, they were falling out way less frequently, which was especially evident when washing off mascara (a process where we ordinarily lose a few). Over time, our lashes felt stronger, softer, and more resilient, making this option our top pick for lash strengthening.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This fragrance- and sulfate-free formula felt gentle and kind on our eyes, even for one of us who often experiences eczema flare-ups around the eye area. She reported that the serum felt nice against her eyelid and didn't exacerbate the existing redness.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When removing the brush from the base, it attracts just the right amount of product needed to slide the serum across your lids without any dripping from the corner of your eye or leaving a sticky residue. Instead, it hugged our lash line and absorbed into the skin in less than five minutes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you already have nice-looking lashes, however, you probably won’t notice much of a difference in length.

This means that anyone who already has long lashes may not see a huge difference in length, even if a lash serum is applied consistently. Once your max or ideal length is achieved, continue to apply the serum regularly to maintain.<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you apply eyelash serum?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Most brands will provide detailed instructions on how to apply their specific eyelash serum. Many serums come with an applicator (not unlike a slim liquid eyeliner), which you gently brush along your eyelids to deposit product.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You want to make sure the product is applied to the lash line and wait the recommended amount of time to allow it to sink in. There are a few brands, like the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Vichy LiftActiv Eyelash Growth Serum</a>, which don’t come with an applicator. Instead, you use your finger to lightly dab along your lashes. Make sure to do so with clean hands to avoid any unwanted bacteria from entering the eyes.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Are eyelash serums safe?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In general, “over the counter lash serums are safe to use,” says Dr. Castilla. “Although they are not FDA tested, cosmetic companies often do their own safety testing.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To stay on the safe side, it’s important to closely read the ingredients list and check the packaging to see whether a dermatologist tested or approved the formula. The only lash serum approved by the FDA for lash growth is the prescription serum, Latisse, according to Dr. Castilla, so you’ll need to visit your doctor to determine whether you’re a candidate.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s also important to take appropriate precautions. Imani advises her clients to find products that work for their body. “If there are any signs of discoloration or irritation, stop using immediately," cautions Imani, who adds that that serums tend to spread easily, so if you get a little overzealous with your application, take a q-tip to wipe off excess product.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What helps eyelashes grow?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Lash serums target the anagen phase, which refers to the growth phase of the hair cycle. “This makes the hair appear thicker, fuller, and in some instances, darker,” explains Dr. Gohara.
