More than two years after <strong>Jack White</strong> and <strong>Karen Elson</strong>'s initial separation — which they celebrated with a "divorce party" to "honor" their marriage — the "Blunderbuss" rocker and the British singer have finalized their divorce, <a href=#>TMZ</a> and other outlets report.</p><p>According to court documents, the agreement was signed by a Nashville judge on Nov. 26. Per the papers, Elson is the "primary residential parent" for the couple's two children, Scarlett, 7, and Henry, 6. White will have about 150 days a year with them.</p><p>TMZ notes that the rocker has agreed to pay $3,200 a month in child support, a small fraction of the $62,000 a month he reportedly earns. He will reportedly retain all rights to his musical businesses, including The White Stripes, The Raconteurs, Dead Weather, and Third Man Records.</p><p>Married since June 2005, White and Elson announced their separation in 2011. "We feel so fortunate for the time we have shared and the time we will continue to spend both separately and together watching our children grow," they said at the time.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Earlier this year however, things between the two turned ugly, with Elson requesting a restraining order against her estranged spouse amid allegations of harassment. She claimed he had a "violent temper and a tendency of sending harassing emails and text messages." (White, for his part, denied the allegations.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmZOgeri0yK2cZp6Zo66ttdmeqmacmau8s6%2FEZp2rp51iuKK%2BxKdknqSjpLtuucCknKxlZmd9cXyMmmSmp56ptW5%2Bj2pqamthZ3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
