But in many ways, her work has never felt more of the moment than it does right now. Since the early 1960s, Saar’s prints, assemblages, collages, and installations, which often incorporate found and discarded objects, have radically explored notions of history, identity, racism, sexism, mysticism, and even the very nature of art. One of her best-known pieces, 1972’s The Liberation of Aunt Jemima, which the activist Angela Davis once credited with sparking the Black women’s movement, recast the racist caricature emblazoned on bottles of supermarket syrup as a revolutionary warrior figure prepared to wrest herself free from that kind of oppression. (“She’s liberated! Finally at long last!” Saar posted on Instagram after Quaker Oats announced that it was retiring the Aunt Jemima brand name and logo—just last year.) At 94, Saar is in the midst of a period in which appreciation for her groundbreaking oeuvre is at a fever pitch, punctuated by pre-pandemic solo shows at New York’s Museum of Modern Art and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. But Saar’s proudest legacy is her family. Born in L.A. and raised in Pasadena, Saar was already a mother of two when she embarked on her journey into artmaking, and all three of her daughters—painter and mixed-media artist Lezley Saar, sculptor and printmaker Alison Saar, and writer Tracye Saar-Cavanaugh—went on to pursue creative careers of their own. In late March, Lezley, Alison, and Tracye gathered with Betye at Tracye’s home, not far from the Laurel Canyon neighborhood where the sisters grew up, to discuss coming of age in a house full of creative women and the role that art has played in their lives.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>BETYE SAAR: </strong>We first moved to Laurel Canyon in the early 1960s. As I recall, Lezley was in school, Alison was just starting kindergarten or first grade, and Tracye was a young girl still at home with me. This period was really important to us because that’s when we all developed our artistic skills. Dick Saar, their father, was a ceramist and had his own business, so we always had financial aid through the art process. I decided to go back to get a teaching credential and went to [California] State University, Northridge. I had an interest in printmaking and began to develop a career in it, which led me from the craft into the fine arts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>ALISON SAAR: </strong>You were doing printmaking even before we moved to Laurel Canyon. Because I remember you were at Cal State Long Beach when I was a toddler. Lezley was already in school, and then you would take me to school with you sometimes. So I was really exposed to the printmaking process. I think you did a silk screen when you were pregnant with Tracye.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>TRACYE SAAR-CAVANAUGH: </strong>Anticipation [1961]. That’s the one that was at LACMA, of her pregnant with me.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>ALISON: </strong>So it seems like in your early work you were drawing a lot on being a mother, which was really probably taking up most of your time. I’m surprised you found any time to make art, to be honest.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>LEZLEY SAAR: </strong>Well, you had us as nearby subjects. That’s handy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>ALSION: </strong>That’s true! But I think by the time we moved to Laurel Canyon our dad had given up his ceramics studio.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>LEZLEY: </strong>That’s sort of where it all began, because our dad and his brother had Saar Ceramics, which operated out of an old army Quonset hut. I remember, before I was even in school, walking down the dark aisles of these stacked crates of clay and having imaginary friends. I would talk to them inside these dark crevices.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>ALISON: </strong>It was dark and damp in there. And there was this inferno at the back. When the kiln was going, it was a really dramatic space.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>LEZLEY: </strong>So we do remember these environments where art was being made. But it’s true that Betye didn’t set up her printing press and begin etching until we moved to the house in Laurel Canyon.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>TRACYE: </strong>I remember the printing press in the old studio being at one end. We would pretend it was a ship’s wheel. The pirate ship.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>LEZLEY: </strong>I’m surprised none of us got our hands smashed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>TRACYE: </strong>It was a dangerous thing. We survived.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>BETYE: </strong>I didn’t know! But art was always just part of our natural environment. It was never about making a commitment and saying, “I want to be an artist … .” It just seemed to be a kind of organic unfolding, of being involved with making things.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>LEZLEY: </strong>Absolutely. It was sort of project-oriented or utilitarian. You had this round table, so we’d say, “Let’s make a mosaic on top of it!” And then we’d learn how to smash up the bits of little mosaic tiles and form designs.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Art was always just part of our natural environment. It was never about making a commitment and saying, “I want to be an artist....” It just seemed to be a kind of organic unfolding, of being involved with making things.<br>—Betye Saar—<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>ALSION: </strong>It seems like you always had a lot of things going on at once, even if that was just to keep us busy at home. We weren’t going out and doing a lot of things. I mean, we all had classes at some point. We’d go to Barnsdall [Art Park in Los Angeles] and whatnot …. Barnsdall used to have that annual art fair. And we would all make a piece of art and submit it. We sold a lot of that work. It was, like, $5 or $10 apiece.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>TRACYE: </strong>Somebody has that work now and has a jackpot. Wow.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>LEZLEY: </strong>And it wasn’t just art, which was nice. We took drama lessons from Phyllis and Ron Patterson, who started the Renaissance Pleasure Faire [in Laurel Canyon]. We took dance lessons.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>ALISON: </strong>Right. So it wasn’t like you were trying to make us be one thing or the other.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>LEZLEY: </strong>Mom used to belly-dance. Remember you were a belly dancer?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>BETYE: </strong>Oh, yes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>TRACYE: </strong>I saw those albums down in the garage, her belly-dancing albums. We should keep those.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>BETYE: </strong>That’s who we were. In my house, when I was a child we always had projects going. We would have puppet shows, or we would make dresses or costumes to wear. That was just how our mother raised us, to have a project going. I extended that to my own family, and you’ve extended it to your families.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>TRACYE: </strong>But thinking back to Grandma, who had been a nursery school teacher—she had a large family, and coming up with projects like that is a way to manage your kids’ time. So it was busywork, but it was also creative work.</p><img alt="betye in a gray shirt, gray scarf, and gray circle earrings standing in front of a green hedge and tree branch" title="betye in a gray shirt, gray scarf, and gray circle earrings standing in front of a green hedge and tree branch" width=1080 height=720 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz050121voicessaar-002-1620330527.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Texas Isaiah</span><p>Betye Saar</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>BETYE: </strong>Alison, when you finished high school and started college, that’s when you began to think seriously about being an artist. Is that right?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>ALISON: </strong>Well, I wanted to be an art historian but then gave up and became an artist.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>TRACYE: </strong>Why did you give up being an art historian?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>ALISON: </strong>I was a better maker than writer. But so much of that goes back to making stuff at home. We were just talking about making clothes … . You asked me recently to find a photo of us all wearing matching outfits, because Mom would buy one fabric and make outfits for all of us.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>TRACYE:</strong> It was like the von Trapps! We were all dressed in the same fabric. I had the jumper, and you had the romper, and she had the A-line …</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>LEZLEY: </strong>Those ’60s colors! Pink and orange and green and blue …</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>ALISON: </strong>I wish I had those dresses now.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>LEZLEY: </strong>But that was great, just to learn the skill of sewing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>BETYE: </strong>I had that experience of learning to make costumes. After I separated from your dad, I needed to get a job, so I went down to the Inner City [Cultural Center] theater and got a job there making costumes. I was a costumer for several years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>ALISON: </strong>We learned The Fantasticks line by line.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>BETYE: </strong>I think all of the employment we’ve had has been involved with the arts—except you, Tracye.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>TRACYE: </strong>The black sheep. I worked in television, yeah. I was the only one with a real job—or corporate job.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>ALISON: </strong>Where you actually had to clock in. None of us had the real work experience.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>TRACYE: </strong>I got a W-2!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>LEZLEY: </strong>It was a real gift, though, growing up in a creative family. Especially watching you, Mom—how you would dress. We’d go out, and you’d get so many compliments. And we knew you made that dress or got this exotic fabric from someplace or from a friend.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>TRACYE: </strong>The leopard fringe dress.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>LEZLEY: </strong>My daughter still wears that leopard miniskirt and minidress from the ’60s.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>TRACYE: </strong>And then Maddy [Alison’s daughter] wore it to one of Betye’s openings. It gets shorter and shorter every time one of the grandkids puts it on.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>LEZLEY: </strong>I think what we learned, with regard to beauty, was that you don’t need to have a lot of money.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>BETYE: </strong>But you do need imagination.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>ALISON:</strong> I also think we probably got in early on the thrift-store thing. That’s where we would go, to thrift stores.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>TRACYE: </strong>Then Betye got that Bernina sewing machine. I remember she made a denim jacket with all of this embroidery over the back and appliquéd it up for me. That was a prized possession.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>BETYE: </strong>It seemed like the rule without it being a rule, starting with my sister and me when we were teenagers, that if you want something new to wear, then you had to make it. And I think that theme carried into our adult lives. Even if you find something, then you still take up a hem or add something to make it your own.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>TRACYE: </strong>You’re always big on changing the buttons.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=52 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>BETYE: </strong>Change the buttons. Do something to it.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>I think what we learned, with regard to beauty, was that you don’t need to have a lot of money.<br>—Lezley Saar—<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=54 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>TRACYE: </strong>How do we feel we’ve all been affected by this past year?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=55 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>BETYE: </strong>What’s a creative life in the time of the Covid?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=56 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>TRACYE: </strong>You’ve been very creative. You’re always in your upstairs studio doing your paintings, your watercolors. And you weren’t making those before. You would only really do those when you’d travel. So in your Covid period, you’ve been doing your watercolors.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=57 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>BETYE: </strong>At this late date in the artistic career, I started to paint. Because usually I’ve always worked at mixed media, assemblage, or collage. And now the collages are becoming paintings, with a little element of collage. And I find that interesting. I probably just will do that for a while, until I get bored with it. Because I thought: “I’m tired of being an artist. Am I going to be an artist anymore?” But then I didn’t have anything else to do, so I went back to making collages—large collages, on 20-inch-by-30-inch or something, which is large for me, because I’ve always worked rather small. It’s not that I’m super excited about it, but I am interested in doing it. And I’ll probably just do that until it’s over.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=58 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>LEZLEY: </strong>Being such a hermit myself, the Covid business has not been that different. But I do miss going out to hear music. It’s nice to go out and get some sort of inspiration. Some kind of outside influence, I think, is important.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=59 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>ALISON: </strong>Tracye, you got your place in the desert.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=60 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>TRACYE: </strong>Yeah. Our place near Joshua Tree—our “Yonderosa” creative ranch. That’s what’s been helping us. It’s been a good distraction, a kind of thing to look forward to. And Betye’s looking forward to coming out more. We got her a trailer. She’s been scrounging around the property and finding rusty things to put together into some rusty installation out there.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=61 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>LEZLEY: </strong>It’s going to be great.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=62 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>ALISON: </strong>Yeah.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=63 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>TRACYE: </strong>What else are you looking forward to, Mom?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=64 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>BETYE: </strong>Well, I’m very satisfied with my life. My house is paid for, all my bills. I’m not in debt. I’m educated, as far as I want to be educated … I may be crazy, but it’s creative craziness. I like to make things. And so right now I’m just interested, as far as the artmaking goes, in collages and so forth. And just living my life and enjoying my family. I’m happy.</p><h2 data-node-id=66 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">This article originally appears in the May 2021 issue of Harper's BAZAAR, available on newsstands now.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=67 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://store.harpersbazaar.com/harper-s-bazaar-magazine.html data-vars-ga-call-to-action="GET THE LATEST ISSUE OF BAZAAR" rel=nofollow data-href=https://store.harpersbazaar.com/harper-s-bazaar-magazine.html data-skimlinks-tracking=[utm_source|[utm_campaign|[utm_medium|[gclid|[msclkid|[fbclid|[refdomain|[content_id|2949a0e8-54c8-4442-90ca-7ce5cf6e3276[content_product_id|[product_retailer_id| data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-product-id=631a32a0-2a5d-4541-9a9a-b389be06510e data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-product-url=https://store.harpersbazaar.com/harper-s-bazaar-magazine.html data-affiliate=false data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-product-price=$10.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=c37e0075-e04b-47ba-8204-6b8e6d4dee42 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category="Printer Ink & Toner" class="body-btn-link product-links-button css-1xbq6k6 e1aq0z090">GET THE LATEST ISSUE OF BAZAAR</a><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmMKtwNSrnGielZbBtr7ErGaaa2ZmhXN8mHFmm52krrJuv8CaqWackaq0qcDEq6pmoZ5isLC61Z6prJmknryvew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
