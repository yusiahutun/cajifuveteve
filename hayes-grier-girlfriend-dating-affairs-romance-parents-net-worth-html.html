But, it seems like 'romance' is not his forte, as he&nbsp;appears to be single in front of the public eye, as for now. However, to one's wonder,&nbsp;it seems&nbsp;like there are&nbsp;possible reasons why&nbsp;the young heartthrob doesn't have a lady in his life. So, let's dive in to find out!&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-606 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Why Hayes Grier Not Dating?&nbsp;</h2><p>While many celebs keep their personal life private for the obvious reasons that they don't want to share their life publicly, chances are there lies different reason&nbsp;for the Internet personality, Hayes Grier.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the 17-year-old Instagram star has been uploading funny videos on his social media to date, he has been keeping his personal front, concealed to himself and doesn't seemingly share a romantic relationship currently. However, he has been involved in controversies several times which includes his fake photos and feud with his&nbsp;ex-girlfriend.&nbsp;</p><p>Around June 2015, Hayes found himself tangled in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">rumor</a> of having a girlfriend that started from a fake photo created by a fan.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Fake photo of Hayes Grier kissing his girlfriend that became trending on Twitter&nbsp;</strong>(Photo: j-14.com) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>The photo immediately fooled fans as well as Hayes himself. But, he didn't take long to clarify that the picture was indeed a fake one via his Twitter on June 8, 2015.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p></p>&nbsp;But, that's not it!&nbsp;<p>Hayes found himself caught in internet drama, yet again! But, this time it was with his ex-girlfriend, Jordan Griffis. Although the details of Haye's relationship with Jordan didn't surface to the media, it seems as though they didn't end on good terms. The ex-lovers kept throwing shade at each other on Twitter.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Around March 2016, he got involved in a fight on Twitter with his ex-girlfriend after she ranted about Hayes meeting with <a href=# rel=follow>Justin Bieber</a>&nbsp;at his birthday party. On February 28, 2016, Jordan tweeted about how Hayes hung out with Justin and the fact that she will never understand why.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>Hayes Grier's ex-girlfriend, Jordan Griffis calling out Hayes on Twitter.&nbsp;</strong>(j-14.com)</p><p>On the same day, Hayes's ex also uploaded a picture of him with Justin Bieber only to mock saying that he is not worthy to have met with Justin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Hayes's ex, Jordan Griffis posts his photo with Justin Bieber&nbsp;</strong>(Photo: j-14.com)</p><p>However, Hayes immediately threw the shade back at his ex as he responded with a series of tweets which were apparently aimed at Jordan. Although his tweets reportedly got deleted, fans saved the screenshots of his tweets, and it seems like he wasn't offended by his ex-girlfriend.&nbsp;</p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><strong>Hayes's reportedly deleted tweets which were responses to his ex&nbsp;</strong>(Superfame.com)&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, besides the controversies and Twitter drama, he was seen together&nbsp;with a possible <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">girlfriend</a> around early June 2016. In one of Willie Sosa's Snapchat story, Hayes was spotted with a brunette girl sitting on his lap. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Hayes Grier with a mysterious girl on his lap as seen in one of Willie Sosa's Snapchat Story&nbsp;</strong>(Published on June 4, 2016)&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Although it is quite challenging to clarify the person as Hayes and the identity of the girl, fans were confident it was Hayes based on&nbsp;his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">outfits</a>.
