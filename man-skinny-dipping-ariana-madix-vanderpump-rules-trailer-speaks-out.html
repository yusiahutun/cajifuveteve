And the man has now revealed himself as Brett Kenyon -- and he wants everyone to know that he's not straight.</p><p>Brett spoke out in a TikTok video he shared on Monday.</p><p>"It's me, hi. I am the one naked in the pool with Ariana, and I am gay, so glad we could clear that up," he said, adding, "Make sure you guys support my friendâ€™s show on Wednesdays on Bravo called 'Vanderpump Rules' if you've never heard of it and have been living under a rock for the past 10 years."</p><p>Kenyon responded to some fans who reacted in the comments section of the video. After one user quoted him, writing, "'Itâ€™s meâ€¦and I am gay' lol," Brett replied, "ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ But in case anyone is wondering â€¦ I can totally play straight if anyone wants to cast me on a scripted series ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚."</p><p>Kenyon also posted about the "Vanderpump Rules" trailer on his Instagram Stories, poking fun at how he appeared in the edit.</p><p>"The way the trailer makes me look like I'm straight is the funniest thing ever," he quipped.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load TikTok Post.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Season 10 mid-season tease gave fans their first glimpse at footage filmed after <a href=#>Tom Sandoval's</a> now-infamous affair with <a href=#>Raquel Leviss</a> went public.</p><p>While the trailer starts with more of the <a href=#>Tom Schwartz</a>-Raquel flirtation, the trailer shifts focus to Sandoval and Ariana. He's seen talking about only "having sex four times a year," as she seemingly shuts down suggestion of an open relationship by saying, "I cannot have sex with somebody who feels like a stranger."</p><p>We then see <a href=#>Scheana Shay</a> saying, "This is a full-blown love affair" -- presumably referring to Scandoval -- before Sandoval seemingly tells Ariana, "I wish we both would have tried harder."</p><p>"You don't deserve one f---ing tear of mine," Madix then exclaims, before she's later seen screaming at someone. Tom, meanwhile, says, "You don't know what's going on between us," before Raquel adds, "I don't f---ing regret our relationship."</p><p>Following shots of more tears and shouting, Sandoval asks Ariana if she wants anything. Her cold response: "For you to die."</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> broke the news that <a href=#>Tom Sandoval</a> and<a href=#> Ariana Madix</a> split after nine years together amid the latter's discovery that the former had been cheating on her with costar <a href=#>Raquel Leviss</a>.</p><p>Sources also told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">outlet</a> that Ariana called things off with Tom after she found text messages -- and a video -- on his phone that were said to be "sexual in nature." The insiders added that Madix told friends she discovered Leviss and Sandoval's alleged affair had been going on for months.</p><p>Both Sandoval and Leviss issued public apologies to Madix.</p><p>"Vanderpump Rules" airs Wednesdays on Bravo.</p><a id=gallery-link-2ba5cd67-608d-4462-8e60-406e714e2a1b class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:2ba5cd67-608d-4462-8e60-406e714e2a1b data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:235aaeeb-7c0f-4681-b028-6ab2d0a04584 data-gallery-layout=list><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e6/4by3/2023/03/06/e6c42ba364a84997bd59e2b04f8ef053_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2xma2lfoq6vedKkoKemqWKxqrzPoqWgZZGntqK6wGakmpyZrXq3rc2dnKuopaK9br7UpZysZaSnrqq4xKtkrKiVlri0ec6uq2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
