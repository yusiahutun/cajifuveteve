The two became friends, and later they convert their friendship into a dating relationship. Eventually, the boyfriend-girlfriend relationship gained attraction towards the media and their romance was trending news.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Nearly four years of dating, they got married on 2 November 1996 in St. Brigid Parish of Westbury. After two years of their married life, the duo welcomed their daughter Madeline in 1998.

She was physically assaulted by Bill where he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dragged</a> her down a staircase by the neck. The assault&nbsp;was believed to occur at Manhasset, New York at their home.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Their daughter, Madeline testified on the court, and there was an intense court battle over custody between them.&nbsp;Their divorce was finally concluded in September 2011. After three years battling over the court&nbsp;for against the domestic violence and the dispute over their children, the decision was in favor&nbsp;to Maureen. In April 2015 Nassau County Supreme Court Justice decided that their children were granted to stay with her. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Later in 2016, Bill filed a $10 million lawsuit as he sued his ex-wife, accusing she had misled him regarding their agreement of separation. Due to lack of evidence, the court dismissed this case.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Maureen's Second Marriage</h2><p style=text-align:justify>After she split with her husband Bill in 2010, she allegedly started dating Jeffery Gross.
