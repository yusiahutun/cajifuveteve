I saw his member, but it was covered in a pink fluffy sock," she says in the new issue of <strong><a href=#>Glamour</a></strong>. "Showing it would make people feel bad. It's too fabulous."</p><p>"I don't know why [there's not more male nudity]," she continues. "But I'd like to bring your memory back to Mr. Michiel Huisman [Khaleesi's love interest in seasons four and five] and I copulating for the first time, which began with me saying, 'Take off your clothes,' and then you got to see his perfect bottom."</p><p>We remember and we thank you. In fact, many of the show's viewers are probably thanking her -- as it was revealed the audience skews 40% female.</p><p>"I love that so many women watch the show. If you look at 'Game of Thrones' on face value — blood, tits, dragons, swearwords — you're like, 'Oh, this must be for guys.' But if you take that away, the story lines are fascinating depictions of the struggle for power. And women are in on that conversation."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d7/o/2016/04/05/d7f4468d8e7d5ad5ace1ed160663168c_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p>The 29-year-old actress also briefly opens up about her relationship with ex-boyfriend <strong>Seth MacFarlane</strong>, who she dated from 2012-2013, and what it's like dating in the public eye.</p><p>"Well, a con is you have strangers giving you love-life advice like, 'I'm a big fan of the show, and I'm not sure what you're doing with that guy,' which I didn't react well to," she says. "That happened in New York when Seth and I were together. This guy started to give me advice: 'Can I get a selfie? And by the way…' Unh-unh, bro."</p><p>These days she says she's "just chilling" when it comes to her love life, adding "I've got a good thing going."</p><p>Check out the full interview over at <strong><a href=#>Glamour</a></strong>.
