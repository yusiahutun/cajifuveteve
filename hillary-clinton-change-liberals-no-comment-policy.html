Hillary Clinton is not going to save you.
She’s not your mother, your best friend or your confessor; a time machine to the 90s, the solution to the nation’s increasing divisiveness, or the correct variable in a complicated equation that equals 538; a reflection of what you want to hear, or the embodiment of what you want a “leader” to believe."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Why does anyone expect a private citizen to say something public about the heartbreak of another family, about the need for healing at this time, about letting the law run its course?</p><p class=dcr-vq85ex>Because, you know, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">President Obama did say almost all of that two weeks ago</a>.</p><p class=dcr-vq85ex>It would be easy enough to dismiss the Hillary-soundbite fever as part of the 24-hour cable-and-internet news cycle: we want recognizable people to say moderately controversial things so that they can be written about and aggregated, played and replayed, then analyzed, dissected, allowed to cool and finally reheated for <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">the increasingly small Sunday talk show audience</a>.</p><p class=dcr-vq85ex>But pundits, reporters and Clinton supporters want her to comment on everything and anything – especially domestic issues – because they want a specific kind of comment: one they didn’t get from Obama.</p><p class=dcr-vq85ex>In certain liberal quarters – not just <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">the erstwhile Puma factions</a> – there is <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">a palpable disaffection with the Obama presidency</a> and, from <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">the Brown statement</a> to <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">his deportation policy</a> to <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">his drone program</a> to <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">the dearth of bankers languishing behind bars</a>, there have been plenty of reasons for liberals to have lost that <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">hopey-changey</a> feel.</p><p class=dcr-vq85ex>Into that expectation gap snuck the Ready For Hillary folks – who <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">reportedly aren’t coordinating with Clinton herself</a> – as they hope to lay groundwork for her comeback. The Hillary hopefuls want her to be, right now, the one thing she most definitely is not: the current president of the United States.</p><p class=dcr-vq85ex>Though she is ostensibly hawking just a (sleep-inducing) <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">memoir of her time in the foreign policy trenches</a> this summer, and <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">has limited her public comments to foreign policy issues</a>, somehow, Clinton still almost seems like the change some Americans have been waiting for.</p><p class=dcr-vq85ex>But <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">as others have noted</a>, there is still virtually no political upside for Clinton to issuing a public statement about much of anything going on in this country – much less about Ferguson, given <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">how deeply divided by race the country remains</a> and how much of that divided sentiment she’d have to win over in both a Democratic primary and a general election, if she did run and secure the nomination. There’s no political upside to Hillary Clinton doing anything right now except to remain as non-controversial as possible – which, even on book tour, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">she didn’t quite manage to achieve</a>. After all, she’s still <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">outpolling her Democrat rivals by more than 50 points</a>, and nationwide support for her is <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">nearly 10 points higher</a> than <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">for Obama</a> – though down from her tenure as Secretary of State, during which time she notably wasn’t running for office.</p><p class=dcr-vq85ex>When it comes to her political career, Clinton is a consummate politician – she is, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">in the parlance of the New York Times</a>, “no angel”. So she isn’t going to resurrect disenfranchised Obama supporters’ passion for politics, and she’s not going to snap her fingers and undo Obama’s extrajudicial killing policy, and she’s not going to go back in time and support same sex marriage any faster or get single-payer pushed through. She’s not going to make grand pronouncements that mend race relations – goodness knows <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">her supporters</a> did <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">their own damage</a> to race relations in 2008 – and, even if she does destroy the glass ceiling in 2016, gender inequality will continue to exist.<br></p><p class=dcr-vq85ex>She might be the first woman to be elected president one day – but 2016 is a long way off. Being the front-runner is great but, to stay there, Clinton knows as well as anyone that she’s better off to stay mum and let her supporters make assumptions than to open her mouth and prove her critics right.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaJuforqmutOiqp%2BqlZp8c3yQbWaarZdkf3h7x6KjpZmirnqkuMinq6imXZi1orrGnmSloZKav6K40malqGWTpLqusc2tZKmnnJ6wug%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
