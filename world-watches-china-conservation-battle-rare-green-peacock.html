Young voices in China’s environmental wilderness struggle to be heard
The 3.6 billion yuan (US$506 million) hydropower project was begun in 2016 by a subsidiary of China’s leading dam builder, the state-owned Power Construction, but has been on hold for the past two years due to a court action filed by the country’s oldest environmental NGO, Friends of Nature."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

project was begun in 2016 by a subsidiary of China’s leading dam builder, the state-owned Power Construction, but has been on hold for the past two years due to a court action filed by the country’s oldest environmental NGO, Friends of Nature.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The court ruled on March 20 the company could neither restrict water flows nor cut down trees in the planned inundation area – believed to be the green peacock’s last remaining habitat – until a post-construction assessment is carried out.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A final decision on the project, which sits on the upper stream of the Red River in central Yunnan’s Shuangbai county, will be made by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Beijing-based Friends of Nature and other Chinese environmental NGOs welcomed the decision, but said the legal win was not the end of their three-year battle but “a new starting point” in their defence of the green peacock.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The ruling means the Jiasa River level one hydropower station, which has posed an enormous threat to China’s biggest and most integrated habitat of green peacocks, is suspended rather than permanently cancelled,” Friends of Nature said in a statement on social media platform WeChat.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The defensive war for the green peacock … has yet to achieve a final victory,” it said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/04/04/5968588c-748f-11ea-ab8f-988daf8efd6f_1320x770_175503.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a public letter, four environmental NGOs in China urged the environment ministry to cancel the project.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“A post-construction environmental assessment could hardly evaluate the potential impacts made by the project, and irreversible damage to the green peacock and other protected species is unlikely to be repaired,” it said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Unless the project is relocated, or measures to prevent harm to the ecosystem are significantly adjusted, the grave impact made by the construction on the habitat of the green peacock would never be erased.”</p>The court decision has implications for China’s massive infrastructure projects in other countries – part of President Xi Jinping’s <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=#

data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The way in which the case plays out will be watched, not just in China but around the world, in terms of how Chinese authorities and companies are taking seriously threats to biodiversity in the construction of hydropower dams and other energy and infrastructure projects,” said Maureen Harris, Southeast Asia programme director with International Rivers, a California-based NGO.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China’s environmental record will be under the international spotlight in October, when government representatives from around the world are due to gather in Kunming and agree a 10-year plan to save declining species and natural ecosystems.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It will be the first time China has hosted a major biodiversity summit, and is seen as part of Beijing’s push for greater global influence in a range of areas.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“[This] reflects the Chinese government’s willingness to play a more important role in biodiversity protection globally,” said Pan Wenjing, forest and oceans manager for Greenpeace East Asia.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a

with one million plant and animal species on the verge of extinction – more than at any other period in human history, and threatening “the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As one of the 17 mega-biodiversity countries in the world, according to the United Nations, China has stepped up its efforts to preserve biodiversity in recent years. The ivory trade and processing activities have been illegal since 2018 and commercial logging of natural forests is banned nationwide.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China has also banned commercial fishing on the Yangtse, Asia’s longest river. And, in the wake of the deadly coronavirus outbreak – first reported at a wet market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December – Beijing last month announced a permanent ban on the trade and consumption of wildlife.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But there have been challenges on how to implement the legislation, especially as local governments struggle to balance economic growth and environmental gains. “The central government needs to have a clearer stand with more mandatory, practical and accessible measures,” Pan said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Lights off around the globe for Earth Hour amid coronavirus restrictions</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Beijing could also introduce mandatory measures that could effectively regulate Chinese companies’ practices overseas, she said, “for example, a stricter and more transparent environmental influence assessment process, which would ensure higher environmental standards and listening to local communities’ voices”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chinese companies have faced a growing backlash in a number of countries for failing to protect the environment.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Indonesia, activists have vowed to keep fighting a China-funded and constructed dam project in North Sumatra which they say threatens the tropical rainforest habitat of the Tapanuli orangutan, the world’s rarest great ape.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And in Africa, experts in Guinea warned last year that a China-built dam would kill up to 1,500 chimpanzees if plans to inundate a nearby national park went ahead.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316"><a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Sign up now</span></a> and get a 10% discount (original price US$400) off the China AI Report 2020 by SCMP Research.
