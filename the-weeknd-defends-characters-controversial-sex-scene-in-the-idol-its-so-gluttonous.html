"It's all those emotions adding up to: This guy is in way over his head, this situation is one where he is not supposed to be here."</p><p>Tesfaye went on to share thoughts about his character, calling Tedros a "douchebag" and "such a loser."</p><p>"You look at him, and this is a score -- Jocelyn might be the biggest score he's ever had. It's very obvious," he told GQ. "He's over-indulging, he walks into this house looking around like, 'Goddamn, am I way over my head? This can be the biggest job I've ever done.' Whatever it is that he's doing."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:3239717b-a012-4221-bf3a-72fec42ce7bc data-container-ref=toofab:article:15fac69b-7439-4a7d-b15c-b627dbb6257e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/af/5by4/2023/05/24/af1b231d460242daba55068f05fbe6e7_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Lily-Rose Depp Reacts to Dad Johnny Depp's Standing Ovation at Cannes</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Even the sex, it's so gluttonous. Especially in episode 2," he added. "'Gluttony' is the only word I can think of [to describe it]. He can't believe he's there. He comes off like such a loser. Those moments are the humanity that you find in a psychopath, the chink in his armor."</p><p>Tesfaye said "there's nothing really mysterious or hypnotizing" about his character, noting that everything about his appearance was intentional. "We did that on purpose with his look, his outfits, his hair -- the guy’s a douchebag. You can tell he cares so much about what he looks like, and he thinks he looks good. But then you see these weird moments of him alone -- he rehearses, he's calculated. And he needs to do that, or he has nothing, he's pathetic. Which is true of a lot of people who are a fish out of water, put into these scenarios."</p><p>"The Idol" airs new episodes every Sunday on HBO.</p><a id=gallery-link-c1675e8f-b3e0-48be-b236-3ae78fccd7a5 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:c1675e8f-b3e0-48be-b236-3ae78fccd7a5 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:15fac69b-7439-4a7d-b15c-b627dbb6257e data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/8b/4by3/2023/06/13/8b0027230b25419e89e60fe231517344_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j29mamxfqbWmedaenKSmlGKxprLEp5usZZOdrrOtwq2cq6tdmLyvwNGorZ6qo56urXnSnq9mq5Oau6Z5yKdkraCVYralu8tmoK2rXai8brPLrqutp56kwrR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
