The <strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Hollywood Arms</a></strong>, which was once frequented by Prince Harry, serves lazy weekend brunches and Sunday roasts (when open). It even has its own gin and cocktail lounge, the Boulevard Bar (pictured) which can be used for private hire.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f583d1309ff9-chiltern-a.jpg><h2>Chiltern Firehouse</h2><h3>Spotted: Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank</h3><p id=emU2IT-1b8Q3>It's well known that anyone who's anyone gets a table at Chiltern Firehouse. Owned by André Balazs, who's also behind LA's Chateau Marmont Hotel and The Standard hotel chain, its modern European menu focuses heavily on seasonality. A former fire station, the venue has hosted the likes of&nbsp;Brooklyn Beckham,&nbsp;Bradley Cooper,&nbsp;Cara Delevingne&nbsp;and it's where&nbsp;<strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Eugenie</a></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;Jack Brooksbank&nbsp;celebrated their engagement in 2018.</p><p id=eSjU_CHASmIA><strong>MORE:</strong>&nbsp;<strong><a class=hm-link href=#>The royal family's favourite takeaways revealed – from curry to Nando's</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8ad3ff987e7f-story-a.jpg><h2>Restaurant Story, Bermondsey</h2><h3>Spotted: Princess Beatrice</h3><p id=e8KVbRFcZb2Y><strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Andrew</a></strong>'s eldest daughter was one step ahead of the game when she ate here in 2013, because just five months later it was awarded a Michelin star. The restaurant, built on the site of a former toilet block on trendy Bermondsey's Tooley Street&nbsp;is understated but stylish with floor-to-ceiling windows and an open kitchen.</p><p id=ex7gqIsO89dR>The food is imaginative and experimental and aims to tell the chef-owner Tom Sellers' life story through the dishes. One of the creative signature dishes, Bread and Dripping, always gets diners talking. An edible beef dripping candle is lit at the table and served with bread to mop up the melted 'wax'. The 'three bears porridge' dessert is a charming, innovative trio of bowls of hot oats – one too sweet, one too salty and one just right. An impressive wine list and stellar service complete the special fine dining experience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0b580bf0810d-quaglinos-a.jpg><h2>Quaglino's</h2><h3>Spotted: The Queen</h3><p id=eO7eHTO32wfP>After Quaglino's hosted <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>the Queen</a></strong> following her coronation in 1952 it instantly became a hit.

She's previously even been seen dining outside with her mother,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Carole, and sister,&nbsp;Pippa. The menu consists of classic dishes like steak, burgers and fish and chips.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6e5ae6cedc8b-bumpkin-a.jpg><h2>Bumpkin – South Kensington, Westfield</h2><h3>Spotted: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge</h3><p id=eJ-9sLA10_Ll>The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge treated 27 members of their staff to a Christmas lunch at Bumpkin in 2012.
