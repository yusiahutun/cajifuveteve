Harms, M.D., leading obstetrician at the Mayo Clinic in the U.S.</span></p><p style=font-weight:700><span>'Also, your growing uterus puts pressure on your veins, which impairs return of blood to your heart. In turn, this can lead to swelling in the legs, ankles and feet. Hormonal changes might play a role as well.'</span></p><p style=font-weight:700><span>To avoid cankles, he suggests a number of measures:</span></p><ul style=font-weight:700><li><span>Sleep on your left side</span></li></ul><p><span>This takes pressure off the inferior vena cava - the large vein that returns blood from the lower half of your body to your heart. </span><span><br></span></p><ul style=font-weight:700><li><span>Stand in water</span></li></ul><p><span>Standing in a pool can compress tissues in the legs and might provide temporary relief.</span></p><ul style=font-weight:700><li><span>Stay cool</span></li></ul><p><span>It might be soothing to apply cold-water compresses to swollen areas.</span></p><ul style=font-weight:700><li><span>Wear compression stockings</span></li></ul><p><span>Your midwife or GP might recommend wearing supportive tights or stockings.</span></p><ul style=font-weight:700><li><span>Drink plenty of fluids</span></li></ul><p><span>The Institute of Medicine recommends about two litres of fluids a day during pregnancy.</span></p><ul style=font-weight:700><li><span>Exercise</span></li></ul><p><span>Walking and swimming can alleviate swelling.</span><br><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br></p><ul style=font-weight:700><li><span>Stay off your feet</span></li></ul><p><span>Avoid standing for long periods, and don't cross your legs.</span></p><p><span>When you can, sit with your feet up and occasionally rotate your feet at the ankles.<br></span></p><p><span>Better still, lie down with your legs elevated.</span></p><p><span>She paired the item with a Kardashian staple - a pair of leather trousers.</span></p><p><span>The reality matriarch and manager also got around in a pair of sky-high heels - hers a pair of suede ankle boots.</span></p><p><span>The mother-of-six also toted a patterned Givenchy handbag - the designer a favourite of the family.</span></p><p><span>Earlier this month, Kim complained about her swollen feet when she tweeted a snap of them after wearing caged Givenchy boots all day.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/05/16/article-2325813-19D2B8A1000005DC-217_634x859.jpg height=859 width=634 alt="Off to run some errands: Kim may
