The Starry Eyed singer is currently touring the US, putting on a series of free gigs, including a daytime one at LACMA (Los Angeles County Museum of Art), in order to raise her profile stateside. Kristen is a committed fan of Hereford-born Ellie and was spotted at one of her gigs in LA in November. While the pair got into the party spirit, thousands of miles away Kristen’s Twilight co-star and beau was filming his new movie, The Rover.&nbsp;</p><p id=eeoCyWHBDZD data-wc=75>The couple have been hit with fresh claims that their relationship is in trouble after Kristen didn't walk the red carpet with Rob at the <a class=hm-link href=#>Golden Globes</a>. However, she did join him at the West Hollywood's Soho House private afterparty, until well after midnight. But they did not put in a loved-up appearance at the bash, with one onlooker commenting that the pair, "hung around each other, but [they weren't] on top of each other."&nbsp;</p><p id=ekLuoQD08Cy data-wc=81>The Twilight couple's romance was thrust into the spotlight last summer when Kristen admitted a "momentary indiscretion" with film director <strong>Rupert Saunders</strong>, who is married to British model <strong>Liberty Ross</strong>. There have been reports in the UK that Britain-born Robert called time on their relationship over Christmas, which they apparently spent apart. They did spend the Thanksgiving break together, though, in the UK. They were last seen together in public in November, catching a flight out of New York's JFK airport.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yQbGdraWNmfnKBkGiiq6GjqbKvedKtnLCZoql6prjLopxmn5%2BquaW1zaBkqZmiqcZw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
