Their first two albums, 1992's&nbsp;Confederate Railroad&nbsp;and 1994's&nbsp;Notorious, are certified double-platinum and platinum, respectively. The band most recently released a new album,&nbsp;Lucky to Be Alive, in 2016.</p><p>In 2019, Confederate Railroad made headlines when they had&nbsp;two concerts, at fairs in Illinois and New York, canceled&nbsp;because of objections to the band's name and a logo that incorporates the Confederate flag. At the time, the band agreed to acquiesce to venue rules about merchandise that contains the flag, but Shirley -- a Chattanooga, Tenn., native -- <a href=#>said </a>there was "no way" the band would change its name.</p><p>"All these people who have stood up for us through this, and the millions of people who have bought these records over the years, and especially now, with us being under fire and people taking a stand in our defense&nbsp;...&nbsp;That’d just be a kick in the gut to anyone who ever bought a record by us," Shirley said of the suggestion.</p><p><b>Country Artists Who Have Suffered Tragedy:</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnZmeo8Zuv8eiqaWdqWKwsLrFnpueqpGpsm6%2BwKKjq6eRmXqtscCdZKyhnpyys3nBq6aknZ5ir6Kvymg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
