To understand TikTok from the perspective of a creator, we discussed her social media journey with Maria Jeleniewska, as well as her own experience as an influencer on the network. Let‚Äôs jump in and learn more about what it‚Äôs really like to be a young influencer on the platform!</p><h2><strong>Let‚Äôs start off with a short introduction: Tell us a little bit about yourself.</strong></h2><p>I am Maria Jeleniewska ‚Äì a 19-year-old girl living in Poland. I study New Media at a private University, so being a part of social media and learning about it make my live full of creativity and amazing opportunities. I love doing sports and dancing, leading a healthy lifestyle also by cooking, meditating and reading.</p><h2><strong>How do you balance social media and schoolwork?</strong></h2><p>Sometimes it is hard to balance schoolwork with social media, especially now when we‚Äôre working online due to the pandemic. The lack of motivation, will to sleep longer and do anything but sitting and learning are most common problems in everyone‚Äôs life. I couldn‚Äôt live without my calendar and organizing literally everything I have to do for the weekend and how much time I should spend on some things. Without any plan, I know I wouldn‚Äôt handle everything I need to do. It‚Äôs important to know our priorities and to study this, what we really want to know more about and feel in it. To do everything with pleasure. It also goes with social media ‚Äì do, what you want and when you can. Do not force yourself to it, because you will give up.</p><h2><strong>Which platform did you start creating content first & why?</strong></h2><p>Firstly, I started creating TikTok videos, which became more and more recognition. In my country ‚Äì Poland ‚Äì I am mostly known for my transition videos, which were something really different from what everyone was uploading there few years ago. I think that this made people want to watch my work. I always wanted to do something original and creative, so when I saw TikTok I knew it was the app I should post something on and who would believe it would blow up that much with 13 Million followers now?</p><h2><strong>How would you compare TikTok and Instagram? If you were starting from scratch again, which one would you give importance to?</strong></h2><p>Your video has a chance to get more recognition, become a viral much more on TikTok that your photos on Instagram. Now, when everyone is sitting, scrolling and watching short, dynamic videos, the app is the best option to start your journey with social media. So if I would have to choose one platform to start with, I would again choose TikTok.</p><a title=@jeleniewska href=# rel=noopener>@jeleniewska</a> Przypominam, ≈ºe wciƒÖ≈º mo≈ºecie odtwarzaƒá ten uk≈Çad z <a title=justdance2022 href=# rel=noopener>#JustDance2022</a> i mieƒá szansƒô wygraƒá lekcje ta≈Ñca w @egurrola_official ‚ò∫Ô∏è <a title=tanecznawsp√≥≈Çpraca href=# rel=noopener>#tanecznawsp√≥≈Çpraca</a> <a title="‚ô¨ d≈∫wiƒôk oryginalny - Just Dance Polska" href=# rel=noopener>‚ô¨ d≈∫wiƒôk oryginalny ‚Äì Just Dance Polska</a><h2><strong>What was your first video that really blew up?</strong></h2><p>I am mostly known for my transition videos. Few of them blew up and also became trends few years ago.</p><a title=@jeleniewska href=# rel=noopener>@jeleniewska</a> Kocham Ciƒô, ma≈ÇaüôÉ‚ù§Ô∏è Filmik pamiƒÖtkowy z koncertu Maty, meeeega mi siƒô podoba≈Çoüòç <a title=mata href=# rel=noopener>#Mata</a> <a title=dlaciebie href=# rel=noopener>#dlaciebie</a> <a title=dc href=# rel=noopener>#dc</a> <a title="‚ô¨ Kiss cam (podryw roku) - Mata" href=# rel=noopener>‚ô¨ Kiss cam (podryw roku) ‚Äì Mata</a><h2><strong>Is there anything that all of your most popular videos all have in common?</strong></h2><p>I try to show my lifestyle, be authentic and tell some stories throughout my videos ‚Äì something that people could relate to. I also spend some time looking for trends, trendy sounds I could use. I really recommend doing it, because it can give your video more chance to become a viral.</p><a title=@jeleniewska href=# rel=noopener>@jeleniewska</a> <a title=newyork href=# rel=noopener>#newyork</a> <a title=statueofliberty href=# rel=noopener>#statueofliberty</a> <a title="‚ô¨ Chiquitita x Twilight - twibytez" href=# rel=noopener>‚ô¨ Chiquitita x Twilight ‚Äì twibytez</a><h2><strong>If you could collaborate with any TikToker, who would that be?</strong></h2><p>I love watching American TikTok stars so I would be the happiest in the world if I could have a chance to even meet Charlie D‚ÄôAmelio, Avani Gregg or Loren Gray.</p><h2><strong>How has the pandemic affected the way you make content?</strong></h2><p>The content on TikTok has changed so much. There are new trends every 2nd day, so I gave up on my transition videos to focus more on trends.</p><a title=@jeleniewska href=# rel=noopener>@jeleniewska</a>Warszawkaüòéüòéüòé<a title="‚ô¨ Let's Groove - absolutesnacc" href=# rel=noopener>‚ô¨ Let‚Äôs Groove ‚Äì absolutesnacc</a><h2><strong>Is being an influencer something you want to pursue as a career?</strong></h2><p>I don‚Äôt really consider being an influencer as a career. I do it for fun, I love the contact with my followers and how they make me feel loved and adored in some way. It can really boost your self-esteem if you don‚Äôt believe in yourself which was my biggest problem. Everyone has their ‚Äú5 minutes‚Äù and social media isn‚Äôt the only thing I am thinking of to do in the future. You always have to have your Plan B, when something would go wrong. That‚Äôs why I like studying, deepening my knowledge by reading, leading healthy lifestyle and having a good relations with family and friends. These are my priorities.</p><p><strong>Do you have TikTok? What do you think of this social network?
