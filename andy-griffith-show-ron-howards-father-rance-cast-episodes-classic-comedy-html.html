He was there to mentor Ron as a young actor and that he did. He recalled the show that propelled Ron into the Griffith Show: The Danny Thomas Show. The latter program served as a vehicle for The Andy Griffith Show‘s <a href=#>pilot episode</a>.</p><p id=par-11_81>“I was also interested in being available myself to help Ron,” he said. “When he did The Danny Thomas Show, he was 5 years old. When he started doing The Andy Griffith Show, he had just turned 6. He couldn’t read, so I was sort of his dialogue coach. I taught him his lines. I wanted to be available to continue sort of on that track. Sheldon was friendly with that. That’s sort of how I became involved in [the show].”</p><h2 id=h-rance-appeared-in-and-wrote-an-episode-for-the-andy-griffith-show>Rance appeared in and wrote an episode for ‘The Andy Griffith Show’</h2><p id=par-12_23>Rance’s guest appearances on&nbsp;Andy Griffith Show&nbsp;episodes include “Cousin Virgil,” “A Black Day for Mayberry,” “Barney and the Governor,” and “The Rumor.”</p><p id=par-13_61>The actor also wrote “The Ball Game,” an episode from the show’s seventh season.
