She taught me so much about life and inspired me indelibly by watching her work. Katherine was a gift to our business and to the world, and will be deeply missed.”</p><p>In an interview with Deadline Hollywood,&nbsp;Tony Danza said: “She was such an influence on me. From being a single guy with a hit show in Hollywood, though my marriage and having kids — she was with me. No matter what problem I had, I could go to her. Very few people could match her.”</p><p>Alyssa Milano, who played Danza’s daughter on the show, tweeted,&nbsp;“My beautiful, kind, funny, gracious, compassionate, rock. You were an instrumental part of my life. You taught me to hold my head above the marsh! You taught me to do anything for a laugh! What an example you were!”</p><p>Danny Pintauro, who played Light’s son, added,&nbsp;“I couldn’t have asked for a better grandmother and I will miss her so dearly.”</p><p>Helmond, who was also known for her performance as the Tate matriarch on the groundbreaking comedy “Soap,” died of Alzheimer’s complications at her home in Los Angeles Feb. 28.</p><p>She received four Best Actress Emmy Award nominations for the groundbreaking 1970 show as the ditzy Jessica Tate and had two nominations for her role on “Who’s The Boss,” where she played the flirty, sexy Mona Robinson. She won the Best Actress Golden Globe Award for “Soap” in 1981 and Supporting Actress for “Who’s The Boss” in 1989. She revived her role as Jessica Tate in two episodes of “Benson,” a spinoff of “Soap.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>We lost one of the most genuine and kind people I have ever known. There’s not a single person who can say otherwise – she was always smiling, full of heart, and had the best advice. I couldn’t have asked for a better grandmother and I will miss her so dearly. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/0fapCPQWuV</a></p><p>— Danny Pintauro (@dannypintauro) <a href=#>March 1, 2019</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>We all lost a national treasure today.
