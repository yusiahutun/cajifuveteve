But using those classics as outfit inspiration? Hmm, that hadn't really occurred to us — until now, of course. No matter the type of celebration on our list (small and intimate, a gathering with old friends,) we're always down <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>to go all out</a> when it comes to fashion. Taking a few tips and tricks from our favorite characters — or outright copying their full look — definitely seems to fall in line with that kind of attitude.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, it's not as if what Cameron Diaz wears in The Holiday is too far from our norm, and we've already lusted over Sandra Bullock's sweaters from While You Were Sleeping. Even if these films are now decades old, the clothes are surprisingly still on-trend in 2021.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Take a look at the holiday movie outfits we're recreating, ASAP — even if we just wear them from the comfort of our home (and post on Instagram).</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-holiday></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Holiday</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">No matter what you've got going on at the end of the year, chances are you'll still need <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a warm coat</a> — and the one that Amanda Woods (Diaz) wears in this rom-com is pretty darn dreamy. We love how she added color to this neutral look with the help of a statement scarf, and added a cute winter hat to pull it all together.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kat Slootsky</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The 2021 version of the memorable layer is now a white puffer coat paired with a coordinating hat and a multi-colored scarf. And, even though we were focusing on outerwear here, we can't resist showing off a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sweet festive sweater</a>, light-wash jeans, and brown, lace-up boots — a cool combination that will no doubt work for multiple events, this season and beyond.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-while-you-were-sleeping></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>While You Were Sleeping</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Did you know this movie technically came out in April of 1995? Regardless, we still think of it as a holiday must-watch (because it does take place around Christmastime). Every year, we consistently 'ooh' and 'ahh' over Lucy's (Sandra Bullock) comfy outfits. From the sweaters to the sweats, this girl really knew how to lounge in style.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kat Slootsky</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sure, nothing will compare to Lucy's iconic gray sweater (which literally looks like a cute, material hug), but there a solid cashmere option, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>this one from Naked Cashmere</a>, can come pretty close. While she initially puts up her tree in jeans (Lucy, wyd?!), she takes down her decorations while wearing sweats, which can even be replaced by a more elevated choice, such as knit pants. Pink <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Brother Vellies Cloud Socks</a> will complete the look — while also keep our feet from freezing as we kick back and relax.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-santa-clause></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Santa Clause</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After a night at the North Pole, Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) wakes up wearing a matching red set, because, you know, he's now the new Santa Claus. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Festive pajamas</a> are pretty much a wardrobe essential during the month of December, and a silky option is both super luxe and perfect for that early-morning or late-night photo with your presents.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kat Slootsky</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, not everyone celebrates Christmas or enjoys the color red, so feel free to invest in a pink set instead, which is similar enough but versatile for year-round wear. Plan to hop on a call with the fam or feel an urge to say in your PJs all day? Quickly spice up your look with holiday earrings. BaubleBar has plenty available for purchase for a reasonable price.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-elf></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Elf</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Listen, Buddy the Elf (Will Ferrell) might have stood out in his green coat and yellow tights, but he was honestly on the right track. Personally, we'd ditch the hat and the pointed-toe shoes, but that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>bright color combination</a> is what our street style dreams are made of, and, clearly, it makes a statement. In reality, this pairing is a fun one to experiment with as the year comes to a close.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kat Slootsky</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sticking to that same scheme, we replaced Buddy's green jacket with a simple green sweater and layered it over a white mockneck bodysuit. Yellow jeans replaced the tights, while practical, white bulky boots or sneakers worked for footwear. Still feeling like your outfit is missing something? Add a pair of drop earrings for a hint of sparkle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Photographs by Kat Slootsky, assisted by Ricky Jackson.
