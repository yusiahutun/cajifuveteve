"The lyrics, the melodies, the subtle touches; this album is the very best effort from our group. These songs were brought to life and curated to reflect where my life is now: happy, fulfilled, blessed."</p><p>"From love songs to songs about friendship, from ballads to bangers, this album has it all. They're true-life songs,"&nbsp;Abbott continues. "I hope people listen to this record and go, 'Man, Josh is in a great place.'"</p><p>The singer credits that grounded-ness to his newfound role as a father and a husband, per a press release. While composing&nbsp;The Highway Kind, Abbott and his wife relocated from Austin, Texas, to Nashville, Tenn., to soak in the songwriting scene. The band later gathered at Sonic Ranch studio, near El Paso, Texas, to cut the tracks. On the collection's first single and album opener, Abbott finds contentment in a life spent predominantly&nbsp;on the road:</p><p>"I was made for white lines / That go on and on forever / Guys like me don't count the days / We just stack the miles / I've always been the highway kind."</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer alignnone" readability=2><p><span class=visually-hidden>This is the cover art for the Josh Abbott Band's 'The Highway Kind' album.</span></p>Pretty Damn Tough, LLC<p>loading...</p></figure><p><strong>Josh Abbott Band's The Highway Kind Tracklist:</strong></p><p>1.
